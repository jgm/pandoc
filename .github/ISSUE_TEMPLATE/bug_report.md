Thank you for reporting an issue!
Before you continue, please make sure that you have

- reproduced your issue with the latest release of pandoc
  (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases), or online (https://pandoc.org/try).
- searched the issue tracker (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues)
  for similar issues (including closed issues).
- searched the discussion forum
  (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/discussions) for solutions.

If you are experiencing a regression (an unwanted change of
behavior from an earlier version of pandoc), please indicate
this and give relevant version numbers. Be sure to check the
release notes (https://pandoc.org/releases) for relevant
changes, as you might find a solution there.

Note that this bug tracker is for reporting bugs, not asking
questions. For questions, use the discussion forum:

**Explain the problem.**
Include the **exact command line** you used and **all inputs necessary to reproduce the issue**.  Please create as minimal an example as possible, to help the maintainers isolate the problem.  Explain the output you received and how it differs from what you expected.

**Pandoc version?**
What version of pandoc are you using, on what OS? (If it's not the latest release, please try with the latest release before reporting the issue. Note that many linux distributions have old versions of pandoc in their repositories.)
