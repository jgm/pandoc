The [pandoc-templates] repository contains default templates for [pandoc].

If you use custom templates, we recommend forking this
repository, so that you can integrate changes to the default
templates in future pandoc releases.

This repository is a subtree of [pandoc]; it will be updated
each time there is a new pandoc release.  However, changes to
templates are made first in [pandoc]; thus, issues and pull
requests should be made [pandoc]'s issue tracker rather than
here.

[pandoc]: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc
[pandoc-templates]: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates

All of the templates in this repository are dual licensed, under both
the GPL (v2 or higher, same as pandoc) and the BSD 3-clause license
(included below).
