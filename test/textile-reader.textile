This is a set of tests for pandoc Textile Reader. Part of it comes
from John Gruber's markdown test suite.

-----

h1. Headers

h2. Level 2 with an "embedded link":http://www.example.com

h3. Level 3 with *emphasis*

h4. Level 4

h5. Level 5

h6. Level 6


h1. Paragraphs

Here's a regular paragraph.

Line breaks are preserved in textile, so you can not wrap your very
long paragraph with your favourite text editor and have it rendered
with no break.


Here's one with a bullet.

* criminey.

There should be a paragraph break between here

and here.

pandoc converts textile.

h1. Block Quotes

bq. This is a famous quote from somebody. He had a lot of things to
say, so the text is really really long and spans on multiple lines.

And a following paragraph.

h1. Code Blocks

Code:

<pre>
    ---- (should be four hyphens)

    sub status {
        print "working";
    }

	this code block is indented by one tab
</pre>

And:

<pre>
		this code block is indented by two tabs

    These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
</pre>

bc. Code block with .bc
        continued
    @</\

bc.. extended code block

        continued
p. ended by paragraph

Inline code: @<tt>@, <tt>@</tt>.

h1. Notextile

A block of text can be protected with notextile :

<notextile>
No *bold* and
* no bullet
</notextile>

and inlines can be protected with ==double *equals (=)* markup==.

h1. Inline Markup

This is _emphasized_, and so __is this__.
This is *strong*, and so **is this**.
This is +inserted+, and this is -deleted-.
Hyphenated-words-are-ok, as well as strange_underscore_notation.
A "*strong link*":http://www.foobar.com.

_*This is strong and em.*_
So is *_this_* word and __**that one**__.
-This is strikeout and *strong*-

Superscripts: a[^bc^]d a ^*hello*^ a[^hello there^].
Subscripts: ~here~ H[ ~2~]O, H[ ~23~]O, H[ ~many of them~]O.

Dashes : How cool -- automatic dashes.

Elipses : He thought and thought ... and then thought some more.

Quotes and apostrophes : "I'd like to thank you" for example.


h1. Links

h2. Explicit

Just a "url":http://www.url.com

"Email link":mailto:nobody@nowhere.net

"not a link": foo

Automatic linking to "$":http://www.example.com.

"Example":http://www.example.com/: Example of a link followed by a colon.

A link["with brackets":http://www.example.com]and no spaces.

h1. Tables

Textile allows tables with and without headers :

h2. Without headers

| name   | age | sex |
| joan   | 24  | f   |
| archie | 29  | m   |
| bella  | 45  | f   |

h2. With headers

|_. name |_. age |_. sex |
| joan   | 24    | f     |
| archie | 29    | m     |
| bella  | 45    | f     |



h1. Images

Textile inline image syntax, like
here !this_is_an_image.png(this is the alt text)!
and here !this_is_an_image.png!.

h1. Attributes
