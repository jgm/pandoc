h1. {anchor:paragraphs}Paragraphs

Here's a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version 8. This line turns into a list item. Because a hard&hyphen;wrapped line in the middle of a paragraph looked like a list item.

Here's one with a bullet. &ast; criminey.

There should be a hard line break
here.

----

h1. {anchor:block-quotes}Block Quotes

E&hyphen;mail style:

bq. This is a block quote. It is pretty short.


{quote}
Code in a block quote:

{code}
sub status \{
    print &quot;working&quot;;
}
{code}

A list:

# item one
# item two

Nested block quotes:

bq. nested


bq. nested


{quote}

This should not be a block quote: 2 &gt; 1.

And a following paragraph.

h1. {anchor:code-blocks}Code Blocks

Code:

{code}
&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen; (should be four hyphens)

sub status \{

h1. {anchor:html-blocks}HTML Blocks

Simple block on one line:

foo
And nested without indentation:

foo

bar
Interpreted markdown in a table:




This is _emphasized_


And this is *strong*




Here's a simple block:

foo

This should be a code block, though:

{code}
&lt;div&gt;
    foo
&lt;/div&gt;
{code}

As should this:

{code}
&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
{code}

Now, nested:

foo
This should just be an HTML comment:


Multiline:



Code block:

{code}
&lt;!&hyphen;&hyphen; Comment &hyphen;&hyphen;&gt;
{code}

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:


Code:

{code}
&lt;hr /&gt;
{code}

h1. {anchor:inline-markup}Inline Markup

This is _emphasized_, and so _is this_.

This is *strong*, and so *is this*.

An _[emphasized link|/url]_.

*_This is strong and em._*

So is *_this_* word.

*_This is strong and em._*

So is *_this_* word.

This is code: {{&gt;}}, {{$}}, {{\}}, {{\$}}, {{&lt;html&gt;}}.

-This is _strikeout_.-

Superscripts: a{^bc^}d a{^_hello_^} a{^hello there^}.

Subscripts: H{~2~}O, H{~23~}O, H{~many of them~}O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

----

h1. {anchor:smart-quotes-ellipses-dashes}Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes

"Hello," said the spider. "'Shelob' is my name."

'A', 'B', and 'C' are letters.

'Oak,' 'elm,' and 'beech' are names of trees. So is 'pine.'

'He said, "I want to go."' Were you alive in the 70's?

Here is some quoted '{{code}}' and a "[quoted link|http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2]".

Some dashes: one -- two  --  three -- four  --  five.

Dashes between numbers: 5 - 7, 255 - 66, 1987 - 1999.

Ellipses...and...and....

h1. {anchor:latex}LaTeX

* 
* 2 &plus; 2 = 4
* _x_ ∈ _y_
* _α_ ∧ _ω_
* 223
* _p_&hyphen;Tree
* Here's some display math: \\$$\frac\{d}\{dx}f(x)=\lim&lowbar;\{h\to 0}\frac\{f(x&plus;h)&hyphen;f(x)}\{h}$$\\
* Here's one that has a line break in it: _α_ &plus; _ω_ × _x_{^2^}.

These shouldn't be math:

* To get the famous equation, write {{$e = mc^2$}}.
* $22,000 is a _lot_ of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if "lot" is emphasized.)
* Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
* Escaped {{$}}: $73 _this should be emphasized_ 23$.

Here's a LaTeX table:

h1. {anchor:images}Images

From "Voyage dans la Lune" by Georges Melies (1902):

!lalune.jpg!

Here is a movie !movie.jpg! icon.

----

h1. {anchor:footnotes}Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[1] and another.[2] This should _not_ be a footnote reference, because it contains a space.[^my note] Here is an inline note.[3]

bq. Notes can go in quotes.[4]


# And in list items.[5]

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.


[1] Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere after the footnote reference. It need not be placed at the end of the document.


[2] Here's the long note. This one contains multiple blocks.

Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the footnote (as with list items).

{code}
  \{ &lt;code&gt; }
{code}

If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be lazy and just indent the first line of each block.


[3] This is _easier_ to type. Inline notes may contain [links|http://google.com] and {{]}} verbatim characters, as well as [bracketed text].


[4] In quote.


[5] In list.
