This is a set of tests for pandoc.  Most of them are adapted from
John Gruber's markdown test suite.

# Headers

## Level 2 with an [embedded link](/url)

### Level 3 with *emphasis*

#### Level 4

##### Level 5

Level 1
=======

Level 2 with *emphasis*
-----------------------

### Level 3
with no blank line

Level 2
-------
with no blank line

----------

# Paragraphs

Here's a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version
8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the
middle of a paragraph looked like a
list item.

Here's one with a bullet.
* criminey.

There should be a hard line break  
here.

# Block Quotes

E-mail style:

> This is a block quote.
> It is pretty short.

> Code in a block quote: 
> 
>     sub status {
>         print "working";
>     }
> 
> A list: 
> 
> 1. item one
> 2. item two
>
> Nested block quotes:
>
> > nested
>
>>  nested
>

This should not be a block quote: 2
> 1.

And a following paragraph.

* * * *

# Code Blocks

Code:

    ---- (should be four hyphens)

    sub status {
        print "working";
    }

	this code block is indented by one tab

And:

		this code block is indented by two tabs

    These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{

# HTML Blocks

Simple block on one line:

<div>foo</div>

And nested without indentation:

<div>
<div>
<div>
foo
</div>
</div>
<div>bar</div>
</div>

Interpreted markdown in a table:

<table>
<tr>
<td>This is *emphasized*</td>
<td>And this is **strong**</td>
</tr>
</table>

<script type="text/javascript">document.write('This *should not* be interpreted as markdown');</script>

Here's a simple block:

<div>
foo
</div>

This should be a code block, though:

	<div>
		foo
	</div>

As should this:

	<div>foo</div>

Now, nested:

<div>
 <div>
  <div>
  foo
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

This should just be an HTML comment:

<!-- Comment -->

Multiline:

<!--
Blah
Blah
-->

<!--
	This is another comment.
-->

Code block:

	<!-- Comment -->

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

<!-- foo -->   

Code:

	<hr />
	
Hr's:

<hr>

<hr />

<hr />

<hr>   

<hr />  

<hr /> 

<hr class="foo" id="bar" />

<hr class="foo" id="bar" />

<hr class="foo" id="bar">

# Inline Markup

This is *emphasized*, and so _is this_.

This is **strong**, and so __is this__.

An *[emphasized link](/url)*.

***This is strong and em.***

So is ***this*** word.

___This is strong and em.___

So is ___this___ word.

This is code: `>`, `$`, `\`, `\$`, `<html>`.

~~This is *strikeout*.~~

Superscripts:  a^bc^d a^*hello*^ a^hello\ there^.

Subscripts: H~2~O, H~23~O, H~many\ of\ them~O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts,
because of the unescaped spaces:  a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

-----

# Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes

"Hello," said the spider.  "'Shelob' is my name."

'A', 'B', and 'C' are letters.

'Oak,' 'elm,' and 'beech' are names of trees.
So is 'pine.'

'He said, "I want to go."'  Were you alive in the
70's?

Here is some quoted '`code`' and a "[quoted link][1]".

Some dashes:  one---two --- three---four --- five.

Dashes between numbers: 5--7, 255--66, 1987--1999. 

Ellipses...and...and....

# LaTeX

- \cite[22-23]{smith.1899}
- $2+2=4$
- $x \in y$
- $\alpha \wedge \omega$
- $223$ 
- $p$-Tree
- Here's some display math:
  $$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
- Here's one that has a line break in it:  $\alpha + \omega \times
x^2$.  

These shouldn't be math:

- To get the famous equation, write `$e = mc^2$`.
- $22,000 is a *lot* of money.  So is $34,000.
  (It worked if "lot" is emphasized.)
- Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
- Escaped `$`:  $73 *this should be emphasized* 23\$.

Here's a LaTeX table:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
Animal & Number \\ \hline
Dog    & 2      \\
Cat    & 1      \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

* * * * *

# Special Characters

- I hat: Î
- o umlaut: ö
- section: §

Here's a [link with an ampersand in the URL] [1].

Here's a link with an amersand in the link text: [AT&T] [2].

Here's an [inline link](/script?foo=1&bar=2).

Here's an [inline link in pointy braces](</script?foo=1&bar=2>).

[1]: http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2
[2]: http://att.com/  "AT&T" 

## Autolinks

With an ampersand: <http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2>

* In a list?
* <http://example.com/>
* It should.

   [lalune]: lalune.jpg "Voyage dans la Lune"

Here is a movie ![movie](movie.jpg) icon.

# Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]
This should *not* be a footnote reference, because it 
contains a space.[^my note]  Here is an inline note.^[This
is *easier* to type.  Inline notes may contain
[links](http://google.com) and `]` verbatim characters,
as well as [bracketed text].]

> Notes can go in quotes.^[In quote.]

1.  And in list items.^[In list.]

[^longnote]: Here's the long note.  This one contains multiple
blocks.  

    Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the
footnote (as with list items).

          { <code> }

    If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be
    lazy and just indent the first line of each block.

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

  [^1]: Here is the footnote.  It can go anywhere after the footnote
  reference.  It need not be placed at the end of the document.
