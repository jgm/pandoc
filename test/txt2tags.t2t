%!includeconf: rules.conf

This document describes all the details about each txt2tags mark.
The target audience are **experienced** users. You may find it
useful if you want to master the marks or solve a specific problem
about a mark.

If you are new to txt2tags or just want to know which are the
available marks, please read the [Markup Demo MARKUPDEMO].

Note 1: This document is generated directly from the txt2tags
test-suite. All the rules mentioned here are 100% in sync with the
current program code.

Note 2: A good practice is to consult [the sources rules.t2t] when
reading, to see how the texts were made.

%INCLUDED(t2t) starts here: ../../../test/marks/paragraph.t2t


%%% Syntax: Lines grouped together
A paragraph is composed by one or more lines.
A blank line (or a table, or a list) ends the
current paragraph.

%%% Syntax: Leading and trailing spaces are ignored
   Leading and trailing spaces are ignored.   

%%% Syntax: A comment don't close a paragraph
A comment line can be placed inside a paragraph.
% this comment will be ignored
It will not affect it.

%%% Closing: EOF closes the open paragraph
The end of the file (EOF) closes the
currently open paragraph.

%%% Syntax: Marks are greedy and must be "glued" with contents
%% GLUED: The contents must be glued with the marks, no spaces
%% between them. Right after the opening mark there must be a
%% non-blank character, as well as right before the closing mark.
%% 
%% GREEDY: If the contents boundary character is the same as
%% the mark character, it is considered contents, not mark.
%% So ""****bold****"" turns to ""<B>**bold**</B>"" in HTML.

%%% Syntax: Repetition is greedy
%% When the mark character is repeated many times,
%% the contents are expanded to the largest possible.
%% That's why they are greedy, the outer marks are
%% the ones used.

%INCLUDED(t2t) starts here: ../../../test/marks/quote.t2t


	To quote a paragraph, just prefix it by a TAB
	character. All the lines of the paragraph must
	begin with a TAB.
Any non-tabbed line closes the quote block.

%%% Nesting: Creating deeper quotes
	The number of leading TABs identifies the quote
	block depth. This is quote level 1.
		With two TABs, we are on the quote
		level 2.
			The more TABs, more deep is
			the quote level.
				There isn't a limit.

%%% Nesting: Reverse nesting works
				This quote starts at
				level 4.
			Then its depth is decreased.
		Counting down, one by one.
	Until the level 1.

%%% Nesting: Random count
			Unlike lists, any quote block is
			independent, not part of a tree.
	The TAB count don't need to be incremental
	by one.
				The nesting don't need
				to follow any rule.
		Quotes can be opened and closed
		in any way.
					You choose.

%%% Nesting: When not supported
	Some targets (as sgml) don't support the
	nesting of quotes. There is only one quote
	level.
		In this case, no matter how much
		TABs are used to define the quote
		block, it always will be level 1.

%%% Syntax: Spaces after TAB
	  Spaces AFTER the TAB character are allowed.
	  But be careful, it can be confusing.

%%% Invalid: Spaces before TAB
  	Spaces BEFORE the TAB character
  	invalidate the mark. It's not quote.

%%% Invalid: Paragraphs inside
	Paragraph breaks inside a quote aren't
	possible.
	
	This sample are two separated quoted
	paragraphs, not a quote block with
	two paragraphs inside.

%%% Closing: EOF closes the open block
	The end of the file (EOF) closes the
	currently open quote block.

= Numbered List =[numlist]

See [List #list], the same rules apply.

= List =[list]

%INCLUDED(t2t) starts here: ../../../test/marks/list.t2t


%%% Items: Prefixed by hyphen
- Use the hyphen to prefix list items.
- There must be one space after the hyphen.
- The list is closed by two consecutive blank lines.


%%% Items: Free leading spacing (indentation)
     - The list can be indented on the source document.
     - You can use any number of spaces.
     - The result will be the same.


%%% Items: Vertical spacing between items
- Let one blank line between the list items.

- It will be maintained on the conversion.

- Some targets don't support this behavior.
	   	  
- This one was separated by a line with blanks.
  You can also put a blank line inside

  the item contents and it will be preserved.


%%% Items: Exactly ONE space after the hyphen
-This is not a list (no space)

-    This is not a list (more than one space)

-	This is not a list (a TAB instead the space)


%%% Items: Catchy cases
- - This is a list
- + This is a list
- : This is a list


%%% Nesting: Creating sublists
- This is the "mother" list first item.
- Here is the second, but inside this item,
  - there is a sublist, with its own items.
  - Note that the items of the same sublist
  - must have the same indentation.
    - And this can go on, opening sublists.
      - Just add leading spaces before the
      - hyphen and sublists will be opened.
      - The two blank lines closes them all.


%%% Nesting: Free leading spacing (indentation)
- When nesting lists, the additional spaces are free.
 - You can add just one,
        - or many.
          - What matters is to put more than the previous.
          - But remember that the other items of the same list
          - must use the same indentation.


%%% Nesting: Maximum depth
- There is not a depth limit,
  - you can go deeper and deeper.
    - But some targets may have restrictions.
      - The LaTeX maximum is here, 4 levels.


%%% Nesting: Reverse doesn't work
        - Reverse nesting doesn't work.
      - Because a sublist *must* have a mother list.
    - It's the list concept, not a txt2tags limitation.
  - All this sublists will be bumped to mother lists.
- At level 1, like this one.


%%% Nesting: Going deeper and back

%% When nesting back to an upper level, the previous sublist
%% is automatically closed.
- Level 1
  - Level 2
    - Level 3
      - Level 4
    - Level 3 -- (closed Level 4)
  - Level 2 -- (closed Level 3)
- Level 1 -- (closed Level 2)

    - Level 3
% comment lines are NOT considered blank lines
      - Level 4
% comment lines are NOT considered blank lines

  - Level 2 -- blank BEFORE and AFTER (out)

- Level 1
        
  - Level 2 -- blank BEFORE (spaces) and AFTER (TAB)
	
    - Level 3


%%% Nesting: Messing up
%% Be careful when going back on the nesting,
%% it must be on a valid level! If not, it will
%% be bumped up to the previous valid level.
- Level 1
    - Level 2
        - Level 3
            - Level 4
          - Level 3.5 ???
        - Level 3
      - Level 2.5 ???
    - Level 2
  - Level 1.5 ???
- Level 1


%%% Closing: Two (not so) empty lines
- This list is closed by a line with spaces and other with TABs
        
	
- This list is NOT closed by two comment lines
% comment lines are NOT considered blank lines
% comment lines are NOT considered blank lines
- This list is closed by a line with spaces and TAB,
- then a comment line, then an empty line.
	      	
% comment lines are NOT considered blank lines

%%% Closing: Empty item closes current (sub)list

%% The two blank lines closes ALL the lists.
%% To close just the current, use an empty item.
- Level 1
  - Level 2
    - Level 3
    -
    Level 2
  -  
  Level 1

%% The empty item can have trailing blanks.
- Empty item with trailing spaces.

%%% Closing: EOF closes the lists
