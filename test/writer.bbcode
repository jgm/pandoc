This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from John Gruber's markdown test suite.

[u][b]Paragraphs[/b][/u]

Here's a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version 8. This line turns into a list item. Because a hard-wrapped line in the middle of a paragraph looked like a list item.

Here's one with a bullet. * criminey.

There should be a hard line break
here.

[u][b]Block Quotes[/b][/u]

E-mail style:

[quote]
This is a block quote. It is pretty short.
[/quote]

[quote]
Code in a block quote:

[code]sub status {
    print "working";
}
[/code]

A list:

[list=1]
[*]item one
[*]item two
[/list]

Nested block quotes:

[quote]
nested
[/quote]

[quote]
nested
[/quote]
[/quote]

This should not be a block quote: 2 > 1.

And a following paragraph.

* * *

[u][b]Code Blocks[/b][/u]

Code:

[code]---- (should be four hyphens)

sub status {
    print "working";
}

this code block is indented by one tab
[/code]

And:

[code]    this code block is indented by two tabs

These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
[/code]

[u][b]HTML Blocks[/b][/u]

Simple block on one line:

foo

And nested without indentation:

foo

bar

Interpreted markdown in a table:

This is [i]emphasized[/i]

And this is [b]strong[/b]

Here's a simple block:

foo

This should be a code block, though:

[code]<div>
    foo
</div>
[/code]

As should this:

[code]<div>foo</div>
[/code]

Now, nested:

foo

This should just be an HTML comment:

Multiline:

Code block:

[code]<!-- Comment -->
[/code]

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

Code:

[code]<hr />
[/code]

Hr's:

* * *

[u][b]Inline Markup[/b][/u]

This is [i]emphasized[/i], and so [i]is this[/i].

This is [b]strong[/b], and so [b]is this[/b].

An [i][url=/url]emphasized link[/url][/i].

[b][i]This is strong and em.[/i][/b]

So is [b][i]this[/i][/b] word.

[b][i]This is strong and em.[/i][/b]

So is [b][i]this[/i][/b] word.

This is code: >, $, \, \$, <html>.

[s]This is [i]strikeout[/i].[/s]

Superscripts: abcd a[i]hello[/i] ahello there.

Subscripts: H2O, H23O, Hmany of themO.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

* * *

[u][b]Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes[/b][/u]

"Hello," said the spider. "'Shelob' is my name."

'A', 'B', and 'C' are letters.

'Oak,' 'elm,' and 'beech' are names of trees. So is 'pine.'

'He said, "I want to go."' Were you alive in the 70's?

Here is some quoted 'code' and a "[url=http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2]quoted link[/url]".

Some dashes: one---two --- three---four --- five.

Dashes between numbers: 5--7, 255--66, 1987--1999.

Ellipses...and...and....

[*]Here's one that has a line break in it: $\alpha + \omega \times x^2$.
[/list]

These shouldn't be math:

[list]
[*]To get the famous equation, write $e = mc^2$.
[*]$22,000 is a [i]lot[/i] of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if "lot" is emphasized.)
[*]Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
[*]Escaped $: $73 [i]this should be emphasized[/i] 23$.

Here is a movie [img alt="movie"]movie.jpg[/img] icon.

[u][b]Footnotes[/b][/u]

Here is a footnote reference,(1) and another.(2) This should [i]not[/i] be a footnote reference, because it contains a space.[^my note] Here is an inline note.(3)

[quote]
Notes can go in quotes.(4)
[/quote]

[list=1]
[*]And in list items.(5)
[/list]

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

* * *

(1) Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere after the footnote reference. It need not be placed at the end of the document.

(2) Here's the long note. This one contains multiple blocks.

Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the footnote (as with list items).

[code]  { <code> }
[/code]

If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be lazy and just indent the first line of each block.

(3) This is [i]easier[/i] to type. Inline notes may contain [url=http://google.com]links[/url] and ] verbatim characters, as well as [bracketed text].

(4) In quote.

(5) In list.
