This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from John Gruber’s
markdown test suite.

== Headers

=== Level 2 with an link:/url[embedded link]

==== Level 3 with _emphasis_

===== Level 4

====== Level 5

== Level 1

=== Level 2 with _emphasis_

==== Level 3

with no blank line

=== Level 2

with no blank line

'''''

== Paragraphs

Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version 8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the middle of a paragraph looked like a list
item.

Here’s one with a bullet. ++*++ criminey.

There should be a hard line break +
here.

'''''

== Block Quotes

E-mail style:

____
This is a block quote. It is pretty short.
____

____
--
Code in a block quote:

....
sub status {
    print "working";
}
....

A list:

[arabic]
. item one
. item two

Nested block quotes:

____
nested
____

____
nested
____

--
____

This should not be a block quote: 2 ++>++ 1.

And a following paragraph.

'''''

== Code Blocks

Code:

....
---- (should be four hyphens)

sub status {
    print "working";
}

this code block is indented by one tab
....

And:

....
    this code block is indented by two tabs

These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
....

== Definition Lists

Tight using spaces:

apple::
  red fruit
orange::
  orange fruit
banana::
  yellow fruit

apple::
  red fruit
orange::
  orange fruit
banana::
  yellow fruit

Loose:

apple::
  red fruit
orange::
  orange fruit
banana::
  yellow fruit

_apple_::
  red fruit

apple::
  red fruit

orange::
  orange fruit
  +
  [arabic]
  . sublist
  . sublist

== HTML Blocks

Simple block on one line:

foo

And nested without indentation:

foo

bar

Interpreted markdown in a table:

This is _emphasized_

And this is *strong*

Here’s a simple block:

foo

This should be a code block, though:

....
<div>
    foo
</div>
....

As should this:

....
<div>foo</div>
....

Now, nested:

foo

This should just be an HTML comment:

Multiline:

Code block:

....
<!-- Comment -->
....

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

Code:

....
<hr />
....

Hr’s:

'''''

== Inline Markup

This is _emphasized_, and so _is this_.

This is *strong*, and so *is this*.

An _link:/url[emphasized link]_.

*_This is strong and em._*

So is *_this_* word.

*_This is strong and em._*

So is *_this_* word.

This is code: `>`, `$`, `\`, `\$`, `<html>`.

[line-through]#This is _strikeout_.#

Superscripts: a^bc^d a^_hello_^ a^hello there^.

Subscripts: H~2~O, H~23~O, H~many of them~O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped spaces:
a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

'''''

== Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes

``Hello,'' said the spider. ```Shelob' is my name.''

`A', `B', and `C' are letters.

`Oak,' `elm,' and `beech' are names of trees. So is `pine.'

`He said, ``I want to go.''' Were you alive in the 70’s?

Here is some quoted ``code`' and a ``http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2[quoted
link]''.

Some dashes: one—two — three—four — five.

Dashes between numbers: 5–7, 255–66, 1987–1999.

Ellipses…and…and….

'''''

== LaTeX

* 
* latexmath:[$2+2=4$]
* latexmath:[$x \in y$]
* latexmath:[$\alpha \wedge \omega$]
* latexmath:[$223$]
* latexmath:[$p$]-Tree
* Here’s some display math:
+
[latexmath]
++++
\[\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\]
++++
* Here’s one that has a line break in it:
latexmath:[$\alpha + \omega \times x^2$].

These shouldn’t be math:

* To get the famous equation, write `$e = mc^2$`.
* $22,000 is a _lot_ of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if ``lot'' is
emphasized.)
* Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
* Escaped `$`: $73 _this should be emphasized_ 23$.

Here’s a LaTeX table:

'''''

== Special Characters

Here is some unicode:

* I hat: Î
* o umlaut: ö
* section: §
* set membership: ∈
* copyright: ©

AT&T has an ampersand in their name.

AT&T is another way to write it.

This & that.

6 ++>++ 5.

Backslash: ++\++

Backtick: ++`++

Asterisk: ++*++

Underscore: ++_++

'''''

== Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,footnote:[Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere
after the footnote reference. It need not be placed at the end of the document.]
and another.[multiblock footnote omitted] This should _not_ be a footnote
reference, because it contains a space.++[++^my note++]++ Here is an inline
note.footnote:[This is _easier_ to type. Inline notes may contain
http://google.com[links] and `]` verbatim characters, as well as ++[++bracketed
text++]++.]

____
Notes can go in quotes.footnote:[In quote.]
____

[arabic]
. And in list items.footnote:[In list.]

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.
