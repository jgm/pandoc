# Org output with smart quotes turned on

```
% pandoc -t org+smart_quotes -s
"It's nice" she said.
^D
#+options: ':t

"It's nice" she said.
```

Same test, but with special strings turned off.
```
% pandoc -t org+smart_quotes-special_strings -s
"It's nice" she said.
^D
#+options: ':t
#+options: -:nil

"Itâ€™s nice" she said.
```
