                  (i.e., a flow with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP

                  is the send rate, which is the amount of data sent by the
                  sender in unit time. The second is the throughput, which is
                  the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time. Note
                  that the throughput will always be less than or equal to the
                  send rate due to losses. Finally, the number of non-duplicate
                  packets received by the receiver in unit time gives us the
                  goodput of the connection. The goodput is always less than or
                  equal to the throughput, since the receiver may receive two
                  copies of the same packet due to retransmissions by the
                  sender. In a previous paper, we presented a simple model for
                  predicting the steady state send rate of a bulk transfer TCP
                  flow as a function of loss rate and round trip time. In this
                  paper, we extend that work in two ways. First, we analyze the
                  performance of bulk transfer TCP flows using more precise,
                  stochastic analysis. Second, we build upon the previous
                  analysis to provide both an approximate formula as well as a
                  more accurate stochastic model for the steady state throughput
                  of a bulk transfer TCP flow.},
