    - Dates
    - Not included in tests:
        - malformed dates and date ranges
        - literal dates ("13th century"; not supported by biblatex)
        - seasons (would have to come from parsing the issue field)
        - uncertain dates (use "doubtfuldate" from biblatex-apa?)
        - dates with single-digit day or month (not supported by biblatex)
        - negative dates (not supported by biblatex)
    - Note: biblatex supports years < 1000 but only if padded with leading zeros
    - TODO:
        - either biblio2yaml or, probably better, citeproc should strip leading zeros
         from days and months (CSL can add leading zeros to its output, but not remove
         them when they are in its input data)
