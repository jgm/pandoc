pandoc (1.13.1)

  * Fixed `--self-contained` with Windows paths (#1558).
    Previously `C:\foo.js` was being wrongly interpreted as a URI.

  * HTML reader:  improved handling of tags that can be block or inline.
    Previously a section like this would be enclosed in a paragraph,
    with RawInline for the video tags (since video is a tag that can
    be either block or inline):

        <video controls="controls">
           <source src="../videos/test.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
           <source src="../videos/test.webm" type="video/webm" />
           <p>
              The videos can not be played back on your system.<br/>
              Try viewing on Youtube (requires Internet connection):
              <a href="http://youtu.be/etE5urBps_w">Relative Velocity on
        Youtube</a>.
           </p>
        </video>

    This change will cause the video and source tags to be parsed
    as RawBlock instead, giving better output.
    The general change is this:  when we're parsing a "plain" sequence
    of inlines, we don't parse anything that COULD be a block-level tag.

  * Docx reader:

    + Be sensitive to user styles.  Note that "Hyperlink" is
      "blacklisted," as we don't want the default underline styling to be
      inherited by all links by default (Jesse Rosenthal).
    + Read single paragraph in table cell as `Plain` (Jesse Rosenthal).
      This makes to docx reader's native output fit with the way the markdown
      reader understands its markdown output.

  * Textile writer:  Extended the range of cases where native textile
    tables will be used (as opposed to raw HTML):  we now handle any
    alignment type, but only for simple tables with no captions.

  * Txt2Tags reader:

    + Header is now parsed only if standalone flag is set (Matthew Pickering).
    + The header is now parsed as meta information. The first line is the
      `title`, the second is the `author` and third line is the `date`
      (Matthew Pickering).
    + Corrected formatting of `%%mtime` macro (Matthew Pickering).
    + Fixed crash when reading from stdin.

  * EPUB writer:  Don't use page-progression-direction in EPUB2, which
    doesn't support it.  Also, if page-progression-direction not specified
    in metadata, don't include the attribute even in EPUB3; not including it
    is the same as including it with the value "default", as we did before.
    (#1550)

  * Org writer: Accept example lines with indentation at the beginning
    (Calvin Beck).

  * DokuWiki writer:

    + Refactor to use Reader monad (Matthew Pickering).
    + Avoid using raw HTML in table cells; instead, use `\\`
      instead of newlines (Jesse Rosenthal).
    + Properly handle HTML table cell alignments, and use spacing
      to make the tables look prettier (#1566).

  * Docx writer:

    + Bibliography entries get `Bibliography` style (#1559).
    + Implement change tracking (Jesse Rosenthal).

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Fixed a bug that caused a table caption to repeat across all pages
      (Jose Luis Duran).
    + Improved vertical spacing in tables and made it customizable using
      standard lengths set by booktab.  See
      <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/pandoc-discuss/qMu6_5lYy0o/ZAU7lzAIKw0J>
      (Jose Luis Duran).
    + Added `\strut` to fix spacing in multiline tables (Jose Luis Duran).
    + Use `\tabularnewline` instead of `\\` in table cells (Jose Luis Duran).
    + Made horizontal rules more flexible (Jose Luis Duran).

  * Text.Pandoc.MIME:

    + Added `MimeType` (type synonym for `String`) and `getMimeTypeDef`.
      Code cleanups (Artyom Kazak).

  * Templates:

    + LaTeX template: disable microtype protrusion for typewriter font (#1549,
      thanks lemzwerg).

  * Improved OSX build procedure.

  * Added `network-uri` flag, to deal with split of `network-uri` from
    `network`.

  * Fix build dependencies for the `trypandoc` flag, so that they are
    ignored if `trypandoc` flag is set to False (Gabor Pali).

  * Updated README to remove outdated claim that `--self-contained`
    looks in the user data directory for missing files.

pandoc (1.13.0.1)

  * Docx writer:

    + Fixed regression which bungled list numbering (#1544), causing
      all lists to appear as basic ordered lists.
    + Include row width in table rows (Christoffer Ackelman, Viktor Kronvall).
      Added a property to all table rows where the sum of column widths
      is specified in pct (fraction of 5000).  This helps persuade Word
      to lay out the table with the widths we specify.

  * Fixed a bug in Windows 8 which caused pandoc not to find the
    `pandoc-citeproc` filter (#1542).

  * Docx reader: miscellaneous under-the-hood improvements (Jesse Rosenthal).
    Most significantly, the reader now uses Builder, leading to some
    performance improvements.

  * HTML reader:  Parse appropriately styled span as SmallCaps.

  * Markdown writer: don't escape `$`, `^`, `~` when `tex_math_dollars`,
    `superscript`, and `subscript` extensions, respectively, are
    deactivated (#1127).

  * Added `trypandoc` flag to build CGI executable used in the online
    demo.

  * Makefile:  Added 'quick', 'osxpkg' targets.

  * Updated README in templates to indicate templates license.
    The templates are dual-licensed, BSD3 and GPL2+.

pandoc (1.13)

  [new features]

  * Added `docx` as an input format (Jesse Rosenthal).  The docx
    reader includes conversion of native Word equations to pandoc
    LaTeX `Math` elements.  Metadata is taken from paragraphs at the
    beginning of the document with styles `Author`, `Title`, `Subtitle`,
    `Date`, and `Abstract`.

  * Added `epub` as an input format (Matthew Pickering).  The epub
    reader includes conversion of MathML to pandoc LaTeX `Math`
    elements.

  * Added `t2t` (Txt2Tags) as an input format (Matthew Pickering).
    Txt2tags is a lightweight markup format described at
    <http://txt2tags.org/>.

  * Added `dokuwiki` as an output format (Clare Macrae).

  * Added `haddock` as an output format.

  * Added `--extract-media` option to extract media contained in a zip
    container (docx or epub) while adjusting image paths to point to the
    extracted images.

  * Added a new markdown extension, `compact_definition_lists`, that
    restores the syntax for definition lists of pandoc 1.12.x, allowing
    tight definition lists with no blank space between items, and
    disallowing lazy wrapping.  (See below under behavior changes.)

  * Added an extension `epub_html_exts` for parsing HTML in EPUBs.

  * Added extensions `native_spans` and `native_divs` to activate
    parsing of material in HTML span or div tags as Pandoc Span
    inlines or Div blocks.

  * `--trace` now works with the Markdown, HTML, Haddock, EPUB,
    Textile, and MediaWiki readers.  This is an option intended
    for debugging parsing problems; ordinary users should not need
    to use it.

  [behavior changes]

  * Changed behavior of the `markdown_attribute` extension, to bring
    it in line with PHP markdown extra and multimarkdown.  Setting
    `markdown="1"` on an outer tag affects all contained tags,
    recursively, until it is reversed with `markdown="0"` (#1378).

  * Revised markdown definition list syntax (#1429).  Both the reader
    and writer are affected.  This change brings pandoc's definition list
    syntax into alignment with that used in PHP markdown extra and
    multimarkdown (with the exception that pandoc is more flexible about
    the definition markers, allowing tildes as well as colons).  Lazily
    wrapped definitions are now allowed.  Blank space is required
    between list items.  The space before a definition is used to determine
    whether it is a paragraph or a "plain" element.  **WARNING: This change
    may break existing documents!**  Either check your documents for
    definition lists without blank space between items, or use
    `markdown+compact_definition_lists` for the old behavior.

  * `.numberLines` now works in fenced code blocks even if no language
    is given (#1287, jgm/highlighting-kate#40).

  * Improvements to `--filter`:

    + Don't search PATH for a filter with an explicit path.
      This fixed a bug wherein `--filter ./caps.py` would run `caps.py` from
      the system path, even if there was a `caps.py` in the working directory.
    + Respect shebang if filter is executable (#1389).
    + Don't print misleading error message.
      Previously pandoc would say that a filter was not found,
      even in a case where the filter had a syntax error.

  * HTML reader:

    + Parse `div` and `span` elements even without `--parse-raw`,
      provided `native_divs` and `native_spans` extensions are set.
      Motivation:  these now generate native pandoc Div and Span
      elements, not raw HTML.
    + Parse EPUB-specific elements if the `epub_html_exts`
      extension is enabled.  These include `switch`, `footnote`,
      `rearnote`, `noteref`.

  * Org reader:

    + Support for inline LaTeX.  Inline LaTeX is now accepted and parsed by the
      org-mode reader.  Both math symbols (like `\tau`) and LaTeX commands (like
      `\cite{Coffee}`), can be used without any further escaping (Albert
      Krewinkel).

  * Textile reader and writer:

    + The `raw_tex` extension is no longer set by default.  You can
      enable it with `textile+raw_tex`.

  * DocBook reader:

    + Support `equation`, `informalequation`, `inlineequation` elements with
      `mml:math` content.  This is converted into LaTeX and put into a Pandoc
      Math inline.

  * Revised `plain` output, largely following the style of Project
    Gutenberg:

    + Emphasis is rendered with `_underscores_`, strong emphasis
      with ALL CAPS.
    + Headings are rendered differently, with space to set them off,
      not with setext style underlines. Level 1 headers are ALL CAPS.
    + Math is rendered using unicode when possible, but without the
      distracting emphasis markers around variables.
    + Footnotes use a regular `[n]` style.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Horizontal rules are now a line across the whole page.
    + Prettier pipe tables.  Columns are now aligned  (#1323).
    + Respect the `raw_html` extension.  `pandoc -t markdown-raw_html`
      no longer emits any raw HTML, including span and div tags
      generated by Span and Div elements.
    + Use span with style for `SmallCaps` (#1360).

  * HTML writer:

    + Autolinks now have class `uri`, and email autolinks have class
      `email`, so they can be styled.

  * Docx writer:

    + Document formatting is carried over from `reference.docx`.
      This includes margins, page size, page orientation, header,
      and footer, including images in headers and footers.
    + Include abstract (if present) with `Abstract` style (#1451).
    + Include subtitle (if present) with `Subtitle` style, rather
      than tacking it on to the title (#1451).

  * Org writer:

    + Write empty span elements with an id attribute as org anchors.
      For example `Span ("uid",[],[]) []` becomes `<<uid>>`.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Put table captions above tables, to match the conventional
      standard.  (Previously they appeared below tables.)
    + Use `\(..\)` instead of `$..$` for inline math (#1464).
    + Use `\nolinkurl` in email autolinks.  This allows them to be styled
      using `\urlstyle{tt}`.  Thanks to Ulrike Fischer for the solution.
    + Use `\textquotesingle` for `'` in inline code.  Otherwise we get
      curly quotes in the PDF output (#1364).
    + Use `\footnote<.>{..}` for notes in beamer, so that footnotes
      do not appear before the overlays in which their markers appear
      (#1525).
    + Don't produce a `\label{..}` for a Div or Span element.  Do produce
      a `\hyperdef{..}` (#1519).

  * EPUB writer:

    + If the metadata includes `page-progression-direction` (which can be
      `ltr` or `rtl`, the `page-progression-direction` attribute will
      be set in the EPUB spine (#1455).

  * Custom lua writers:

    + Custom writers now work with `--template`.
    + Removed HTML header scaffolding from `sample.lua`.
    + Made citation information available in lua writers.

  * `--normalize` and `Text.Pandoc.Shared.normalize` now consolidate
    adjacent `RawBlock`s when possible.

  [API changes]

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Docx`, exporting `readDocx` (Jesse Rosenthal).

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Readers.EPUB`, exporting `readEPUB` (Matthew
    Pickering).

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Txt2Tags`, exporting `readTxt2Tags` (Matthew
    Pickering).

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.DokuWiki`, exporting `writeDokuWiki`
    (Clare Macrae).

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.Haddock`, exporting `writeHaddock`.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.MediaBag`, exporting `MediaBag`, `lookupMedia`,
    `insertMedia`, `mediaDirectory`, `extractMediaBag`.  The docx and epub
    readers return a pair of a `Pandoc` document and a `MediaBag` with
    the media resources they contain.  This can be extracted using
    `--extract-media`.  Writers that incorporate media (PDF, Docx,
    ODT, EPUB, RTF, or HTML formats with `--self-contained`) will look
    for resources in the `MediaBag` generated by the reader, in addition to
    the file system or web.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Readers.TexMath`: Removed deprecated `readTeXMath`.
    Renamed `readTeXMath'` to `texMathToInlines`.

  * `Text.Pandoc`: Added `Reader` data type (Matthew Pickering).
    `readers` now associates names of readers with `Reader`
     structures.  This allows inclusion of readers, like the docx
     reader, that take binary rather than textual input.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:

    + Added `capitalize` (Artyom Kazak), and replaced uses of
      `map toUpper` (which give bad results for many languages).
    + Added `collapseFilePath`, which removes intermediate `.` and
      `..` from a path (Matthew Pickering).
    + Added `fetchItem'`, which works like `fetchItem` but searches
      a `MediaBag` before looking on the net or file system.
    + Added `withTempDir`.
    + Added `removeFormatting`.
    + Added `extractSpaces` (from HTML reader) and generalized its type
      so that it can be used by the docx reader (Matthew Pickering).
    + Added `ordNub`.
    + Added `normalizeInlines`, `normalizeBlocks`.
    + `normalize` is now `Pandoc -> Pandoc` instead of
      `Data a :: a -> a`.  Some users may need to change their uses of
      `normalize` to the newly exported `normalizeInlines` or
      `normalizeBlocks`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Options`:

    + Added `writerMediaBag` to `WriterOptions`.
    + Removed deprecated and no longer used `readerStrict` in
      `ReaderOptions`.  This is handled by `readerExtensions` now.
    + Added `Ext_compact_definition_lists`.
    + Added `Ext_epub_html_exts`.
    + Added `Ext_native_divs` and `Ext_native_spans`.
      This allows users to turn off the default pandoc behavior of
      parsing contents of div and span tags in markdown and HTML
      as native pandoc Div blocks and Span inlines.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + Generalized `readWith` to `readWithM` (Matthew Pickering).
    + Export `runParserT` and `Stream` (Matthew Pickering).
    + Added `HasQuoteContext` type class (Matthew Pickering).
    + Generalized types of `mathInline`, `smartPunctuation`, `quoted`,
      `singleQuoted`, `doubleQuoted`, `failIfInQuoteContext`,
      `applyMacros` (Matthew Pickering).
    + Added custom `token` (Matthew Pickering).
    + Added `stateInHtmlBlock` to `ParserState`.  This is used to keep
      track of the ending tag we're waiting for when we're parsing inside
      HTML block tags.
    + Added `stateMarkdownAttribute` to `ParserState`. This is used
      to keep track of whether the markdown attribute has been set in
      an enclosing tag.
    + Generalized type of `registerHeader`, using new type classes
      `HasReaderOptions`, `HasIdentifierList`, `HasHeaderMap` (Matthew
      Pickering).  These allow certain common functions to be reused
      even in parsers that use custom state (instead of `ParserState`),
      such as the MediaWiki reader.
    + Moved `inlineMath`, `displayMath` from Markdown reader to Parsing,
      and generalized their types (Matthew Pickering).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Pretty`:

    + Added `nestle`.
    + Added `blanklines`, which guarantees a certain number of blank lines
      (and no more).

  [bug fixes]

  * Markdown reader:

    + Fixed parsing of indented code in list items.  Indented code
      at the beginning of a list item must be indented eight spaces
      from the margin (or edge of the container), or four spaces
      from the list marker, whichever is greater.
    + Fixed small bug in HTML parsing with `markdown_attribute`, which
      caused incorrect tag nesting for input like
      `<aside markdown="1">*hi*</aside>`.
    + Fixed regression with intraword underscores (#1121).
    + Improved parsing of inline links containing quote characters (#1534).
    + Slight rewrite of `enclosure`/`emphOrStrong` code.
    + Revamped raw HTML block parsing in markdown (#1330).
      We no longer include trailing spaces and newlines in the
      raw blocks.  We look for closing tags for elements (but without
      backtracking).  Each block-level tag is its own `RawBlock`;
      we no longer try to consolidate them (though `--normalize` will do so).
    + Combine consecutive latex environments.  This helps when you have
      two minipages which can't have blank lines between them (#690, #1196).
    + Support smallcaps through span.
      `<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">foo</span>` will be
      parsed as a `SmallCaps` inline, and will work in all output
      formats that support small caps (#1360).
    + Prevent spurious line breaks after list items (#1137).  When the
      `hard_line_breaks` option was specified, pandoc would formerly
      produce a spurious line break after a tight list item.
    + Fixed table parsing bug (#1333).
    + Handle `c++` and `objective-c` as language identifiers in
      github-style fenced blocks (#1318).
    + Inline math must have nonspace before final `$` (#1313).

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Handle comments at the end of tables.  This resolves the issue
      illustrated in <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24009489>.
    + Correctly handle table rows with too few cells.  LaTeX seems to
      treat them as if they have empty cells at the end  (#241).
    + Handle leading/trailing spaces in `\emph` better.
      `\emph{ hi }` gets parsed as `[Space, Emph [Str "hi"], Space]`
      so that we don't get things like `* hi *` in markdown output.
      Also applies to `\textbf` and some other constructions (#1146).
    + Don't assume preamble doesn't contain environments (#1338).
    + Allow (and discard) optional argument for `\caption` (James Aspnes).

  * HTML reader:

    + Fixed major parsing problem with HTML tables.  Table cells were
      being combined into one cell (#1341).
    + Fixed performance issue with malformed HTML tables.
      We let a `</table>` tag close an open `<tr>` or `<td>` (#1167).
    + Allow space between `<col>` and `</col>`.
    + Added `audio` and `source` in `eitherBlockOrInline`.
    + Moved `video`, `svg`, `progress`, `script`, `noscript`, `svg` from
      `blockTags` to `eitherBlockOrInline`.
    + `map` and `object` were mistakenly in both lists; they have been removed
      from `blockTags`.
    + Ignore `DOCTYPE` and `xml` declarations.

  * MediaWiki reader:

    + Don't parse backslash escapes inside `<source>` (#1445).
    + Tightened up template parsing.
      The opening `{{` must be followed by an alphanumeric or `:`.
      This prevents the exponential slowdown in #1033.
    + Support "Bild" for images.

  * DocBook reader:

    + Better handle elements inside code environments.  Pandoc's document
      model does not allow structure inside code blocks, but at least this way
      we preserve the text (#1449).
    + Support `<?asciidoc-br?>` (#1236).

  * Textile reader:

    + Fixed list parsing. Lists can now start without an intervening
      blank line (#1513).
    + HTML block-level tags that do not start a line are parsed as
      inline HTML and do not interrupt paragraphs (as in RedCloth).

  * Org reader:

    + Make tildes create inline code (#1345).  Also relabeled `code` and
      `verbatim` parsers to accord with the org-mode manual.
    + Respect `:exports` header argument in code blocks (Craig Bosma).
    + Fixed tight lists with sublists (#1437).

  * EPUB writer:

    + Avoid excess whitespace in `nav.xhtml`.  This should improve
      TOC view in iBooks (#1392).
    + Fixed regression on cover image.
      In 1.12.4 and 1.12.4.2, the cover image would not appear properly,
      because the metadata id was not correct.  Now we derive the id from the
      actual cover image filename, which we preserve rather than using
      "cover-image."
    + Keep newlines between block elements.  This allows
      easier diff-ability (#1424).
    + Use `stringify` instead of custom `plainify`.
    + Use `renderTags'` for all tag rendering.  This properly handles tags
      that should be self-closing.  Previously `<hr/>` would appear in EPUB
      output as `<hr></hr>` (#1420).
    + Better handle HTML media tags.
    + Handle multiple dates with OPF `event` attributes.  Note: in EPUB3 we
      can have only one dc:date, so only the first one is used.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Correctly handle figures in notes.  Notes can't contain figures in
      LaTeX, so we fake it to avoid an error  (#1053).
    + Fixed strikeout + highlighted code (#1294).
      Previously strikeout highlighted code caused an error.

  * ConTeXt writer:

    + Improved detection of autolinks with URLs containing escapes.

  * RTF writer:

    + Improved image embedding: `fetchItem'` is now used to get the
      images, and calculated image sizes are indicated in the RTF.
    + Avoid extra paragraph tags in metadata (#1421).

  * HTML writer:

    + Deactivate "incremental" inside slide speaker notes (#1394).
    + Don't include empty items in the table of contents for
      slide shows.  (These would result from creating a slide
      using a horizontal rule.)

  * MediaWiki writer:

    + Minor renaming of `st` prefixed names.

  * AsciiDoc writer:

    + Double up emphasis and strong emphasis markers in intraword
      contexts, as required by asciidoc (#1441).

  * Markdown writer:

    + Avoid wrapping that might start a list, blockquote, or header (#1013).
    + Use Span instead of (hackish) `SmallCaps` in `plainify`.
    + Don't use braced attributes for fenced code (#1416).
      If `Ext_fenced_code_attributes` is not set, the first class
      attribute will be printed after the opening fence as a bare word.
    + Separate adjacent lists of the same kind with an HTML comment (#1458).

  * PDF writer:

    + Fixed treatment of data uris for images (#1062).

  * Docx writer:

    + Use Compact style for empty table cells (#1353).
      Otherwise we get overly tall lines when there are empty
      table cells and the other cells are compact.
    + Create overrides per-image for `media/` in reference docx.
      This should be somewhat more robust and cover more types of images.
    + Improved `entryFromArchive` to avoid an unneeded parse.
    + Section numbering carries over from reference.docx (#1305).
    + Simplified `abstractNumId` numbering.  Instead of sequential numbering,
      we assign numbers based on the list marker styles.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Options`:

    + Removed `Ext_fenced_code_attributes` from `markdown_github`
      extensions.

  * `Text.Pandoc.ImageSize`:

    + Use default instead of failing if image size not found
      in exif header (#1358).
    + ignore unknown exif header tag rather than crashing.
      Some images seem to have tag type of 256, which was causing
      a runtime error.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:

    + `fetchItem`:  unescape URI encoding before reading local file (#1427).
    + `fetchItem`:  strip a fragment like `?#iefix` from the extension before
      doing mime lookup, to improve mime type guessing.
    + Improved logic of `fetchItem`:  absolute URIs are fetched from the net;
      other things are treated as relative URIs if `sourceURL` is `Just _`,
      otherwise as file paths on the local file system.
    + `fetchItem` now properly handles links without a protocol (#1477).
    + `fetchItem` now escapes characters not allowed in URIs before trying
      to parse the URIs.
    + Fixed runtime error with `compactify'DL` on certain lists (#1452).

  * `pandoc.hs`: Don't strip path off of `writerSourceURL`: the path is
    needed to resolve relative URLs when we fetch resources (#750).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`

    + Simplified `dash` and `ellipsis` (#1419).
    + Removed `(>>~)` in favor of the equivalent `(<*)` (Matthew Pickering).
    + Generalized functions to use `ParsecT` (Matthew Pickering).
    + Added `isbn` and `pmid` to list of recognized schemes (Matthew
      Pickering).

  [template changes]

  * Added haddock template.
  * EPUB3:  Added `type` attribute to `link` tags.  They are supposed to
    be "advisory" in HTML5, but kindlegen seems to require them.
  * EPUB3:  Put title page in section with `epub:type="titlepage"`.
  * LaTeX: Made `\subtitle` work properly (#1327).
  * LaTeX/Beamer: remove conditional around date (#1321).
  * LaTeX:  Added `lot` and `lof` variables, which can be set to
    get `\listoftables` and `\listoffigures` (#1407).  Note that
    these variables can be set at the command line with `-Vlot -Vlof`
    or in YAML metadata.

  [under the hood improvements]

  * Rewrote normalize for efficiency (#1385).

  * Rewrote Haddock reader to use `haddock-library` (#1346).

    + This brings pandoc's rendering of haddock markup in line
      with the new haddock.
    + Fixed line breaks in `@` code blocks.
    + alex and happy are no longer build-depends.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Compat.Directory` to allow building against
    different versions of the `directory` library.

  + Added `Text.Pandoc.Compat.Except` to allow building against
    different verions of `mtl`.

  * Code cleanup in some writers, using Reader monad to avoid
    passing options parameter around (Matej Kollar).

  * Improved readability in `pandoc.hs`.

  * Miscellaneous code cleanups (Artyom Kazak).

  * Avoid `import Prelude hiding (catch)` (#1309, thanks to Michael
    Thompson).

  * Changed `http-conduit` flag to `https`.  Depend on `http-client`
    and `http-client-tls` instead of `http-conduit`.  (Note:  pandoc still
    depends on `conduit` via `yaml`.)

  * Require `highlighting-kate >= 0.5.8.5` (#1271, #1317, Debian #753299).
    This change to highlighting-kate means that PHP fragments no longer need
    to start with `<?php`.  It also fixes a serious bug causing failures with
    ocaml and fsharp.

  * Require latest `texmath`.  This fixes `\tilde{E}` and allows
    `\left` to be used with `]`, `)` etc. (#1319), among many other
    improvements.

  * Require latest `zip-archive`.  This has fixes for unicode path names.

  * Added tests for plain writer.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Templates`:

    + Fail informatively on template syntax errors.
      With the move from parsec to attoparsec, we lost good error
      reporting.  In fact, since we weren't testing for end of input,
      malformed templates would fail silently.  Here we revert back to
      Parsec for better error messages.
    + Use `ordNub` (#1022).

  * Benchmarks:

    + Made benchmarks compile again (Artyom Kazak).
    + Fixed so that the failure of one benchmark does not prevent others
      from running (Artyom Kazak).
    + Use `nfIO` instead of the `getLength` trick to force full evaluation.
    + Changed benchmark to use only the test suite, so that benchmarks
      run more quickly.

  * Windows build script:

    + Add `-windows` to file name.
    + Use one install command for pandoc, pandoc-citeproc.
    + Force install of pandoc-citeproc.

  * `make_osx_package`:  Call zip file `pandoc-VERSION-osx.zip`.
    The zip should not be named `SOMETHING.pkg.zip`, or OSX finder
    will extract it into a folder named `SOMETHING.pkg`, which it
    will interpret as a defective package (#1308).

  * `README`:

    + Made headers for all extensions so they have IDs and can be
      linked to (Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin).
    + Fixed typos (Phillip Alday).
    + Fixed documentation of attributes (#1315).
    + Clarified documentation on small caps (#1360).
    + Better documentation for `fenced_code_attributes` extension
      (Caleb McDaniel).
    + Documented fact that you can put YAML metadata in a separate file
      (#1412).


pandoc (1.12.4.2)

  * Require highlighting-kate >= 0.5.8.  Fixes a performance regression.

  * Shared:  `addMetaValue` now behaves slightly differently:
    if both the new and old values are lists, it concatenates their
    contents to form a new list.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Set `bibliography` in metadata from `\bibliography` or
      `\addbibresource` command.
    + Don't error on `%foo` with no trailing newline.

  * Org reader:

    + Support code block headers (`#+BEGIN_SRC ...`) (Albert Krewinkel).
    + Fix parsing of blank lines within blocks (Albert Krewinkel).
    + Support pandoc citation extension (Albert Krewinkel).  This can
      be turned off by specifying `org-citations` as the input format.

  * Markdown reader:

    + `citeKey` moved to `Text.Pandoc.Parsing` so it can be used by
      other readers (Albert Krewinkel).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + Added `citeKey` (see above).
    + Added `HasLastStrPosition` type class and `updateLastStrPos`
      and `notAfterString` functions.

  * Updated copyright notices (Albert Krewinkel).

  * Added default.icml to data files so it installs with the package.

  * OSX package:

    + The binary is now built with options to ensure that it can be
      used with OSX 10.6+.
    + Moved OSX package materials to osx directory.
    + Added OSX package uninstall script, included in the zip container
      (thanks to Daniel T. Staal).

pandoc (1.12.4)

  * Made it possible to run filters that aren't executable (#1096).
    Pandoc first tries to find the executable (searching the path
    if path isn't given).  If it fails, but the file exists and has
    a `.py`, `.pl`, `.rb`, `.hs`, or `.php` extension, pandoc runs the filter
    using the appropriate interpreter.  This should make it easier to
    use filters on Windows, and make it more convenient for everyone.

  * Added Emacs org-mode reader (Albert Krewinkel).

  * Added InDesign ICML Writer (mb21).

  * MediaWiki reader:

    + Accept image links in more languages (Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz).
    + Fixed bug in certain nested lists (#1213).  If a level 2 list was
      followed by a level 1 list, the first item of the level 1 list
      would be lost.
    + Handle table rows containing just an HTML comment (#1230).

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Give better location information on errors, pointing to line
      numbers within included files (#1274).
    + LaTeX reader:  Better handling of `table` environment (#1204).
      Positioning options no longer rendered verbatim.
    + Better handling of figure and table with caption (#1204).
    + Handle `@{}` and `p{length}` in tabular.  The length is not actually
      recorded, but at least we get a table (#1180).
    + Properly handle `\nocite`.  It now adds a `nocite` metadata
      field.  Citations there will appear in the bibliography but not
      in the text (unless you explicitly put a `$nocite$` variable
      in your template).

  * Markdown reader:

    + Ensure that whole numbers in YAML metadata are rendered without
      decimal points.  (This became necessary with changes to aeson
      and yaml libraries.  aeson >= 0.7 and yaml >= 0.8.8.2 are now required.)
    + Fixed regression on line breaks in strict mode (#1203).
    + Small efficiency improvements.
    + Improved parsing of nested `div`s.  Formerly a closing `div` tag
      would be missed if it came right after other block-level tags.
    + Avoid backtracking when closing `</div>` not found.
    + Fixed bug in reference link parsing in `markdown_mmd`.
    + Fixed a bug in list parsing (#1154).  When reading a raw list
      item, we now strip off up to 4 spaces.
    + Fixed parsing of empty reference link definitions (#1186).
    + Made one-column pipe tables work (#1218).

  * Textile reader:

    + Better support for attributes.  Instead of being ignored, attributes
      are now parsed and included in Span inlines.  The output will be a bit
      different from stock textile: e.g. for `*(foo)hi*`, we'll get
      `<em><span class="foo">hi</span></em>` instead of
      `<em class="foo">hi</em>`.  But at least the data is not lost.
    + Improved treatment of HTML spans (%) (#1115).
    + Improved link parsing.  In particular we now pick up on attributes.
      Since pandoc links can't have attributes, we enclose the whole link in
      a span if there are attributes (#1008).
    + Implemented correct parsing rules for inline markup (#1175, Matthew
      Pickering).
    + Use Builder (Matthew Pickering).
    + Fixed list parsing bug (#1500).
    + Don't allow inline formatting to extend over newlines.
      This matches the behavior of RedCarpet, avoids some ugly bugs,
      and improves performance.

  * DocBook reader:

    + Better treatment of `formalpara`.  We now emit the title (if present)
      as a separate paragraph with boldface text (#1215).
    + Set metadata `author` not `authors`.
    + Added recognition of `authorgroup` and `releaseinfo` elements (#1214,
      Matthew Pickering).
    + Converted current meta information parsing in DocBook to a more
      extensible version which is aware of the more recent meta
      representation (Matthew Pickering).

  * HTML reader:

    + Require tagsoup 0.13.1, to fix a bug with parsing of script tags
      (#1248).
    + Treat processing instructions & declarations as block.  Previously
      these were treated as inline, and included in paragraph tags in HTML
      or DocBook output, which is generally not what is wanted (#1233).
    + Updated `closes` with rules from HTML5 spec.
    + Use Builder (Matthew Pickering, #1162).

  * RST reader:

    + Remove duplicate `http` in PEP links (Albert Krewinkel).
    + Make rst figures true figures (#1168, CasperVector)
    + Enhanced Pandoc's support for rST roles (Merijn Verstaaten).
      rST parser now supports: all built-in rST roles, new role definition,
      role inheritance, though with some limitations.
    + Use `author` rather than `authors` in metadata.
    + Better handling of directives.  We now correctly handle field
      lists that are indented more than three spaces.  We treat an
      `aafig` directive as a code block with attributes, so it can be
      processed in a filter (#1212).

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Mark span contents with label if span has an ID (Albert Krewinkel).
    + Made `--toc-depth` work well with books in latex/pdf output (#1210).
    + Handle line breaks in simple table cells (#1217).
    + Workaround for level 4-5 headers in quotes.  These previously produced
      invalid LaTeX: `\paragraph` or `\subparagraph` in a `quote` environment.
      This adds an `mbox{}` in these contexts to work around the problem.
      See <http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/169833/22451> (#1221).
    + Use `\/` to avoid en-dash ligature instead of `-{}-` (Vaclav Zeman).
      This is to fix LuaLaTeX output. The `-{}-` sequence does not avoid the
      ligature with LuaLaTeX but `\/` does.
    + Fixed string escaping in `hyperref` and `hyperdef` (#1130).

  * ConTeXt writer:  Improved autolinks (#1270).

  * DocBook writer:

    + Improve handling of hard line breaks in Docbook writer
      (Neil Mayhew).  Use a `<literallayout>` for the entire paragraph, not
      just for the newline character.
    + Don't let line breaks inside footnotes influence the enclosing
      paragraph (Neil Mayhew).
    + Distinguish tight and loose lists in DocBook output, using
      `spacing="compact"` (Neil Mayhew, #1250).

  * Docx writer:  When needed files are not present in the user's
    `reference.docx`, fall back on the versions in the `reference.docx`
    in pandoc's data files. This fixes a bug that occurs when a
    `reference.docx` saved by LibreOffice is used. (#1185)

  * EPUB writer:

    + Include extension in epub ids.  This fixes a problem with duplicate
      extensions for fonts and images with the same base name but different
      extensions (#1254).
    + Handle files linked in raw `img` tags (#1170).
    + Handle media in `audio` source tags (#1170).
      Note that we now use a `media` directory rather than `images`.
    + Incorporate files linked in `video` tags (#1170).  `src` and `poster`
      will both be incorporated into `content.opf` and the epub container.

  * HTML writer:

    + Add colgroup around col tags (#877).  Also affects EPUB writer.
    + Fixed bug with unnumbered section headings.  Unnumbered section
      headings (with class `unnumbered`) were getting numbers.
    + Improved detection of image links. Previously image links with
      queries were not recognized, causing `<embed>` to be used instead
      of `<img>`.

  * Man writer:  Ensure that terms in definition lists aren't line wrapped
    (#1195).

  * Markdown writer:

    + Use proper escapes to avoid unwanted lists (#980).  Previously we used
      0-width spaces, an ugly hack.
    + Use longer backtick fences if needed (#1206).  If the content contains a
      backtick fence and there are attributes, make sure longer fences are
      used to delimit the code.  Note:  This works well in pandoc, but github
      markdown is more limited, and will interpret the first string of three
      or more backticks as ending the code block.

  * RST writer:  Avoid stack overflow with certain tables (#1197).

  * RTF writer:  Fixed table cells containing paragraphs.

  * Custom writer:

    + Correctly handle UTF-8 in custom lua scripts (#1189).
    + Fix bugs with lua scripts with mixed-case filenames and
      paths containing `+` or `-` (#1267).  Note that `getWriter`
      in `Text.Pandoc` no longer returns a custom writer on input
      `foo.lua`.

  * AsciiDoc writer:  Handle multiblock and empty table cells
    (#1245, #1246).  Added tests.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Options`: Added `readerTrace` to `ReaderOptions`

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:

    + Added `compactify'DL` (formerly in markdown reader) (Albert Krewinkel).
    + Fixed bug in `toRomanNumeral`:  numbers ending with '9' would
      be rendered as Roman numerals ending with 'IXIV' (#1249).  Thanks to
      Jesse Rosenthal.
    + `openURL`: set proxy with value of http_proxy env variable (#1211).
      Note:  proxies with non-root paths are not supported, due to
      limitations in `http-conduit`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.PDF`:

    + Ensure that temp directories deleted on Windows (#1192).  The PDF is
      now read as a strict bytestring, ensuring that process ownership will
      be terminated, so the temp directory can be deleted.
    + Use `/` as path separators in a few places, even on Windows.
      This seems to be necessary for texlive (#1151, thanks to Tim Lin).
    + Use `;` for `TEXINPUTS` separator on Windows (#1151).
    + Changes to error reporting, to handle non-UTF8 error output.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Templates`:

    + Removed unneeded datatype context (Merijn Verstraaten).

    + YAML objects resolve to "true" in conditionals (#1133).
      Note:  If `address` is a YAML object and you just have `$address$`
      in your template, the word `true` will appear, which may be
      unexpected.  (Previously nothing would appear.)

  * `Text.Pandoc.SelfContained`:

    + `mkSelfContained` now takes just two arguments, `WriterOptions` and
      the string.
    * It no longer looks in data files.  This only made sense when we
      had copies of slidy and S5 code there.
    * `fetchItem'` is used instead of the nearly duplicate `getItem`.
    + Handle `poster` attribute in `video` tags (#1188).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + Made `F` an instance of Applicative (#1138).
    + Added `stateCaption`.
    + Added `HasMacros`, simplified other typeclasses.
      Removed `updateHeaderMap`, `setHeaderMap`, `getHeaderMap`,
      `updateIdentifierList`, `setIdentifierList`, `getIdentifierList`.
    + Changed the smart punctuation parser to return `Inlines`
      rather than `Inline` (Matthew Pickering).
    + Changed `HasReaderOptions`, `HasHeaderMap`, `HasIdentifierList`
      from typeclasses of monads to typeclasses of states.  This simplifies
      the instance definitions and provides more flexibility.  Generalized
      type of `getOption` and added a default definition.  Removed
      `askReaderOption`.  Added `extractReaderOption`.  Added
      `extractHeaderMap` and `updateHeaderMap` in `HasHeaderMap`.
      Gave default definitions for `getHeaderMap`, `putHeaderMap`,
      `modifyHeaderMap`.  Added `extractIdentifierList` and
      `updateIdentifierList` in `HasIdentifierList`.  Gave defaults
      for `getIdentifierList`, `putIdentifierList`, and
      `modifyIdentifierList`.  The ultimate goal here is to allow different
      parsers to use their own, tailored parser states (instead of
      `ParserState`) while still using shared functions.

  * Template changes:

    + LaTeX template: Use `fontenc` package only with `pdflatex` (#1164).
    + LaTeX template:  Add `linestretch` and `fontfamily` variables.
    + LaTeX template:  Conditionalize author and date commands.
    + Beamer template: Consistent styles for figure and table captions
      (aaronwolen).
    + LaTeX and beamer template:  Adjust widths correctly for oversized
      images.  Use `\setkeys{Gin}{}` to set appropriate defaults for
      `\includegraphics` (Yihui Xie, Garrick Aden-Buie).  Load
      `upquote` only after `fontenc` (Yihui Xie).
    + Beamer template: Added caption package (#1200).
    + Beamer template:  changes for better unicode handling (KarolS).
    + DocBook template:  use `authorgroup` if there are authors.
    + revealjs template: Move `include-after` to end (certainlyakey).
    + revealjs template: Fixed PDF print function (#1220, kevinkenan).

  * Bumped version bounds of dependencies.

  * Added a `--trace` command line option, for debugging backtracking
    bugs.  So far this only works with the markdown reader.

  * MathMLinHTML:  Fixed deprecation warning (#362, gwern, Albert Krewinkel).

  * Updated travis script to test with multiple GHC versions.

  * Force failure of a Travis build if GHC produces warnings (Albert
    Krewinkel).

  * Add `.editorconfig` (Albert Krewinkel).
    See <http://editorconfig.org/> for details.

  * Give more useful error message if '-t pdf' is specified (#1155).

  * Added `Cite`, `SmallCaps` to `Arbitrary` instance (#1269).

  * Allow `html4` as a synonym of `html` as a reader (it already works
    as a writer).

  * README:

    + Added an explanation of how to use YAML metadata to
      force items to appear in the bibliography without citations in
      the text (like LaTeX `\nocite`).
    + Added note to `--bibtex/--natbib`: not for use in making PDF
      (#1194, thanks to nahoj).
    + Added explanatory notes about `--natbib` and `--biblatex`.
    + Added specification of legal syntax for citation keys.
    + Fixed variable defaults documentation (Albert Krewinkel).

  * Removed copyright statements for files that have been removed
    (Albert Krewinkel).

  * Moved some doc files from `data-files` to `extra-source-files` (#1123).
    They aren't needed at runtime.  We keep README and COPYRIGHT in data
    to ensure that they'll be available on all systems on which pandoc
    is installed.

  * Use cabal sandboxes in Windows build script.

pandoc (1.12.3.3)

  * To changes to source; recompiled tarball with latest alex and
    happy, so they will work with GHC 7.8.

pandoc (1.12.3.2)

  * Bumped version bounds for blaze-html, blaze-markup.

  * ImageSize:  Avoid use of lookAhead, which is not in binary >= 0.6
    (#1124).

  * Fixed mediawiki ordered list parsing (#1122).

  * HTML reader:  Fixed bug reading inline math with `$$` (#225).

  * Added support for LaTeX style literate Haskell code blocks in rST
    (Merijn Verstraaten).

pandoc (1.12.3.1)

  * Relaxed version constraint on binary, allowing the use of binary 0.5.

pandoc (1.12.3)

  * The `--bibliography` option now sets the `biblio-files` variable.
    So, if you're using `--natbib` or `--biblatex`, you can just use
    `--bibliography=foo.bib` instead of `-V bibliofiles=foo`.

  * Don't run pandoc-citeproc filter if `--bibliography` is
    used together with `--natbib` or `--biblatex` (Florian Eitel).

  * Template changes:

    + Updated beamer template to include booktabs.
    + Added `abstract` variable to LaTeX template.
    + Put `header-includes` after `title` in LaTeX template (#908).
    + Allow use of `\includegraphics[size]` in beamer.
      This just required porting a macro definition from the default
      LaTeX template to the default beamer template.

  * `reference.docx`:  Include `FootnoteText` style.
    Otherwise Word ignores the style, even when specified in the `pPr`.
    (#901)

  * `reference.odt`:  Tidied `styles.xml`.

  * Relaxed version bounds for dependencies.

  * Added `withSocketsDo` around http conduit code in `openURL`,
    so it works on Windows (#1080).

  * Added `Cite` function to `sample.lua`.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Fixed regression in title blocks (#1089).
      If author field was empty, date was being ignored.
    + Allow backslash-newline hard line breaks in grid and
      multiline table cells.
    + Citation keys may now start with underscores, and may contain
      underscores adjacent to internal punctuation.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Add support for `Verb` macro (jrnold) (#1090).
    + Support babel-style quoting: `` "`..."' ``.

  * Properly handle script blocks in strict mode.  (That is,
    `markdown-markdown_in_html_blocks`.) Previously a spurious
    `<p>` tag was being added (#1093).

  * Docbook reader: Avoid failure if `tbody` contains no `tr` or `row`
    elements.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Factored out function for table cell creation.
    + Better treatment of footnotes in tables.
      Notes now appear in the regular sequence, rather than in the
      table cell.  (This was a regression in 1.10.)

  * HTML reader: Parse name/content pairs from meta tags as metadata.
    Closes #1106.

  * Moved `fixDisplayMath` from Docx writer to `Writer.Shared`.

  * OpenDocument writer:  Fixed `RawInline`, `RawBlock` so they don't escape.

  * ODT writer:  Use mathml for proper rendering of formulas.
    Note:  LibreOffice's support for this seems a bit buggy.  But
    it should be better than what we had before.

  * RST writer: Ensure no blank line after def in definition list (#992).

  * Markdown writer: Don't use tilde code blocks with braced attributes in
    `markdown_github` output.  A consequence of this change is that the
    backtick form will be preferred in general if both are enabled.  That
    is good, as it is much more widespread than the tilde form.  (#1084)

  * Docx writer:  Fixed problem with some modified reference docx files.
    Include `word/_rels/settings.xml.rels` if it exists, as well as other
    `rels` files besides the ones pandoc generates explicitly.

  * HTML writer:

    + With `--toc`, headers no longer link to themselves (#1081).
    + Omit footnotes from TOC entries.  Otherwise we get doubled
      footnotes when headers have notes!

  * EPUB writer:

    + Avoid duplicate notes when headings contain notes.
      This arose because the headings are copied into the metadata
      "title" field, and the note gets rendered twice.  We strip the
      note now before putting the heading in "title".
    + Strip out footnotes from toc entries.
    + Fixed bug with `--epub-stylesheet`.  Now the contents of
      `writerEpubStylesheet` (set by `--epub-stylesheet`)
      should again work, and take precedence over a stylesheet specified
      in the metadata.

  * `Text.Pandoc.MIME`: Added `wmf`, `emf`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:  `fetchItem` now handles image URLs beginning
    with `//`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.ImageSize`:  Parse EXIF format JPEGs.  Previously
    we could only get size information for JFIF format, which led
    to squished images in Word documents. Closes #976.

  * Removed old `MarkdownTest_1.0.3` directory (#1104).

pandoc (1.12.2.1)

  * Markdown reader:  Fixed regression in list parser, involving
    continuation lines containing raw HTML (or even verbatim raw HTML).

pandoc (1.12.2)

  * Metadata may now be included in YAML blocks in a markdown document.
    For example,

        ---
        title:
        - type: main
          text: My Book
        - type: subtitle
          text: An investigation of metadata
        creator:
        - role: author
          text: John Smith
        - role: editor
          text: Sarah Jones

    Metadata may still be provided using `--epub-metadata`; it will
    be merged with the metadata in YAML blocks.

  * EPUB writer:

    + `meta` tags are now used instead of `opf` attributes for EPUB3.
    + Insert "svg" property as needed in opf (EPUB 3).
    + Simplify `imageTypeOf` using `getMimeType`.
    + Add properties attribute to `cover-image` item for EPUB 3.
    + Don't include node for `cover.xhtml` if no cover!
    + Ensure that same identifier is used throughout (#1044).
      If an identifier is given in metadata, we use that; otherwise
      we generate a random uuid.
    + Add cover reference to guide element (EPUB 2) (Shaun Attfield).
      Fixes an issue with Calibre putting the cover at the end of the book
      if the spine has `linear="no"`.  Apparently this is best practice
      for other converters as well:
      <http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm#Section2.6>.
    + Allow `stylesheet` in metadata.  The value is a path to the stylesheet.
    + Allow partial dates:  `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`.

  * Markdown writer:  Fix rendering of tight sublists (#1050).
    Previously a spurious blank line was included after a tight sublist.

  * ODT writer:  Add `draw:name` attribute to `draw:frame` elements (#1069).
    This is reported to be necessary to avoid an error from recent
    versions of Libre Office when files contain more than one image
    Thanks to wmanley for reporting and diagnosing the problem.

  * ConTeXt writer:  Don't hardcode figure/table placement and numbering.
    Instead, let this be set in the template, using `\setupfloat`.
    Thanks to on4aa and Aditya Mahajan for the suggestion (#1067).

  * Implemented CSL flipflopping spans in DOCX, LaTeX, and HTML writers.

  * Fixed bug with markdown intraword emphasis.  Closes #1066.

  * Docbook writer:  Hierarchicalize block content in metadata.
    Previously headers just disappeared from block-level metadata
    when it was used in templates.  Now we apply the 'hierarchicalize'
    transformation.  Note that a block headed by a level-2 header will
    turn into a `<sect1>` element.

  * OpenDocument writer:  Skip raw HTML (#1035).
    Previously it was erroneously included as verbatim text.

  * HTML/EPUB writer, footnotes:  Put `<sup>` tag inside `<a>` tags.
    This allows better control of formatting, since the `<a>`
    tags have a distinguishing class (#1049).

  * Docx writer:

    + Use mime type info returned by fetchItem.
    + Fixed core metadata (#1046).
      Don't create empty date nodes if no date given.
      Don't create multiple `dc:creator` nodes; instead separate by
      semicolons.
    + Fix URL for core-properties in `_rels/.rels` (#1046).

  * Plain writer: don't print `<span>` tags.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Fix definition lists with internal links in terms (#1032).
      This fix puts braces around a term that contains an internal
      link, to avoid problems with square brackets.
    + Properly escape pdftitle, pdfauthor (#1059).
    + Use booktabs package for tables (thanks to Jose Luis Duran).

  * Updated beamer template.  Now references should work properly
    (in a slide) when `--biblatex` or `--natbib` is used.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Parse contents of curly quotes or matched `"` as quotes.
    + Support `\textnormal` as span with class `nodecor`.
      This is needed for pandoc-citeproc.
    + Improved citation parsing.  This fixes a run-time error that occured
      with `\citet{}` (empty list of keys).  It also ensures that empty keys
      don't get produced.

  * MediaWiki reader:  Add automatic header identifiers.

  * HTML reader:

    + Use pandoc `Div` and `Span` for raw `<div>`, `<span>` when
      `--parse-raw`.
    + Recognize `svg` tags as block level content (thanks to MinRK).
    + Parse LaTeX math if appropriate options are set.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Yaml block must start immediately after `---`.  If there's a blank
      line after `---`, we interpreted it as a horizontal rule.
    + Correctly handle empty bullet list items.
    + Stop parsing "list lines" when we hit a block tag.
      This fixes exponential slowdown in certain input, e.g.
      a series of lists followed by `</div>`.

  * Slides:  Preserve `<div class="references">` in references slide.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Writer.Shared`:

    + Fixed bug in `tagWithAttrs`.  A space was omitted before key-value
      attributes, leading to invalid HTML.
    + `normalizeDate`: Allow dates with year only (thanks to Shaun Attfield).
    + Fixed bug in `openURL` with `data:` URIs.  Previously the base-64
      encoded bytestring was returned.  We now decode it so it's a proper
      image!

  * DocBook reader:  Handle numerical attributes starting with decimal.
    Also use `safeRead` instead of `read`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Readers.TexMath`: Export `readTeXMath'`, which attends
    to display/inline.  Deprecate `readTeXMath`, and use `readTeXMath'`
    in all the writers.  Require `texmath >= 0.6.5.2`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.MIME`:

    + Add entry for `jfif`.
    + In looking up extensions, drop the encoding info.
      E.g. for 'image/jpg;base64' we should lookup 'image/jpg'.

  * Templates:  Changed how array variables are resolved.  Previously if
    `foo` is an array (which might be because multiple values were set on
    the command line), `$foo$` would resolve to the concatenation of the
    elements of foo.  This is rarely useful behavior.  It has been changed
    so that the first value is rendered.  Of course, you can still iterate
    over the values using `$for(foo)$`.  This has the result that you can
    override earlier settings using `-V` by putting new values later on the
    command line, which is useful for many purposes.

  * `Text.Pandoc`:  Don't default to `pandocExtensions` for all writers.

  * Allow "epub2" as synonym for "epub", "html4" for "html".

  * Don't look for slidy files in data files with `--self-contained`.

  * Allow `https:` command line arguments to be downloaded.

  * Fixed `make_osx_package.sh` so data files embedded in `pandoc-citeproc`.

pandoc (1.12.1)

  * `Text.Pandoc.Definition`:  Changed default JSON serialization format.
    Instead of `{"Str": "foo"}`, for example, we now have `{"t": "Str",
    "c": "foo"}`.  This new format is easier to work with outside of Haskell.
    Incidentally, "t" stands for "tag", "c" for "contents".

  * MediaWiki reader: Trim contents of `<math>` tags, to avoid problems
    when converting to markdown (#1027).

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Ensure that preamble doesn't contribute to the text of
      the document.
    + Fixed character escaping in \url{}.  Previously `\~` wasn't handled
      properly, among others.
    + Parse `{groups}` as `Span`.  This is needed for accurate conversion of
      bibtex titles, since we need to know what was protected from
      titlecase conversions.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Specially escape non-ascii characters in labels.
      Otherwise we can get compile errors and other bugs when
      compiled with pdflatex (#1007).  Thanks to begemotv2718 for the fix.
    + Add link anchors for code blocks with identifiers (#1025).

  * Throughout the code, use `isURI` instead of `isAbsoluteURI`.
    It allows fragments identifiers.

  * Slide formats:

    + A Div element with class "notes" is treated as speaker
      notes.  Currently beamer goes to `\note{}`, revealjs to
      `<aside class="notes">`, and the notes are simply suppressed in
      other formats  (#925).
    + Fixed `. . .` (pause) on HTML slide formats.  Closes #1029.
      The old version caused a pause to be inserted before the first
      material on a slide. This has been fixed.
    + Removed data files for s5, slideous, slidy.
      Users of s5 and slideous will have to download the needed
      files, as has been documented for some time in the README.
      By default, slidy code will be sought on the web, as before.

  * HTML writer: Insert command to typeset mathjax only in slideous output
    (#966, #1012).

  * RST writer:  Skip spaces after display math.  Otherwise we get indentation
    problems, and part of the next paragraph may be rendered as part of the
    math.

  * OpenDocument writer:  Fix formatting of strikeout code (#995),
    thanks to wilx.  don't use `font-face-decls` variable.

  * Fixed test suite so it works with cabal sandboxes.

pandoc (1.12.0.2)

  * Removed `stringable` dependency.

pandoc (1.12.0.1)

  * Allow `--metadata` to be repeated for the same key to form a list.
    This also has the effect that `--bibliography` can be repeated,
    as before.

  * Handle boolean values in `--metadata`.  Note that anything not parseable
    as a YAML boolean or string is treated as a literal string.
    You can get a string value with "yes", or any of the strings interpretable
    as booleans, by quoting it:

        -M boolvalue=yes -M stringvalue='"yes"'

  * LaTeX writer: Don't print references if `--natbib` or `--biblatex`
    option used.

  * DOCX writer: Add `settings.xml` to the zip container.  Fixes a bug
    in which docx files could not be read by some versions of Word
    and LibreOffice (#990).

  * Fixed a regression involving slide shows with bibliographies.
    The Div container around references messed up the procedure for carving
    a document into slides.  So we now remove the surrounding Div in
    `prepSlides`.

  * More informative error message when a filter is not found in path.

  * Depend on pandoc-types 1.12.1.  This provide `ToJSONFilter`
    instances for `Data a => a -> [a]` and `Data a => a -> IO [a]`.

  * Don't use unicode_collation in building OSX package:
    it adds something like 50MB of dependencies to the package.

  * Declare alex and happy as build-tools (#986).

pandoc (1.12)

  [new features]

  * Much more flexible metadata, including arbitrary fields and structured
    values.  Metadata can be specified flexibly in pandoc markdown using
    YAML metadata blocks, which may occur anywhere in the document:

        ---
        title: Here is my title.
        abstract: |
          This is the abstract.

          1. It can contain
          2. block content
             and *inline markup*

        tags: [cat, dog, animal]
        ...

    Metadata fields automatically populate template variables.

  * Added `opml` (OPML) as input and output format.  The `_note` attribute,
    used in OmniOutliner and supported by multimarkdown, is supported.
    We treat the contents as markdown blocks under a section header.

  * Added `haddock` (Haddock markup) as input format (David Lazar).

  * Added `revealjs` output format, for reveal.js HTML 5 slide shows.
    (Thanks to Jamie F. Olson for the initial patch.)
    Nested vertical stacks are used for hierarchical structure.
    Results for more than one level of nesting may be odd.

  * Custom writers can now be written in lua.

        pandoc -t data/sample.lua

    will load the script sample.lua and use it as a custom writer.
    (For a sample, do `pandoc --print-default-data-file sample.lua`.)
    Note that pandoc embeds a lua interpreter, so lua need not be
    installed separately.

  * New `--filter/-F` option to make it easier to run "filters"
    (Pandoc AST transformations that operate on JSON serializations).
    Filters are always passed the name of the output format, so their
    behavior can be tailored to it.  The repository
    <https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters> contains
    a python module for writing pandoc filters in python, with
    a number of examples.

  * Added `--metadata/-M` option.
    This is like `--variable/-V`, but actually adds to metadata, not
    just variables.

  * Added `--print-default-data-file` option, which allows printing
    of any of pandoc's data files. (For example,
    `pandoc --print-default-data-file reference.odt` will print
    `reference.odt`.)

  * Added syntax for "pauses" in slide shows:

        This gives

        . . .

        me pause.

  * New markdown extensions:

    + `ignore_line_breaks`:  causes intra-paragraph line breaks to be ignored,
      rather than being treated as hard line breaks or spaces.  This is useful
      for some East Asian languages, where spaces aren't used between words,
      but text is separated into lines for readability.
    + `yaml_metadata_block`:  Parse YAML metadata blocks.  (Default.)
    + `ascii_identifiers`: This will force `auto_identifiers` to use ASCII
       only. (Default for `markdown_github`.) (#807)
    + `lists_without_preceding_blankline`:  Allow lists to start without
      preceding blank space.  (Default for `markdown_github`.) (#972)

  [behavior changes]

  * `--toc-level` no longer implies `--toc`.
    Reason: EPUB users who don't want a visible TOC may still want
    to set the TOC level for in the book navigation.

  * `--help` now prints in and out formats in alphabetical order, and
    says something about PDF output (#720).

  * `--self-contained` now returns less verbose output (telling you
    which URLs it is fetching, but not giving the full header).  In
    addition, there are better error messages when fetching a URL fails.

  * Citation support is no longer baked in to core pandoc. Users who
    need citations will need to install and use a separate filter
    (`--filter pandoc-citeproc`).  This filter will take `bibliography`,
    `csl`, and `citation-abbreviations` from the metadata, though it
    may still be specified on the command line as before.

  * A `Cite` element is now created in parsing markdown whether or not
    there is a matching reference.

  * The `pandoc-citeproc` script will put the bibliography at the
    end of the document, as before.  However, it will be put inside a `Div`
    element with class "references", allowing users some control
    over the styling of references.  A final header, if any, will
    be included in the `Div`.

  * The markdown writer will not print a bibliography if the
    `citations` extension is enabled.  (If the citations are formatted
    as markdown citations, it is redundant to have a bibliography,
    since one will be generated automatically.)

  * Previously we used to store the directory of the first input file,
    even if it was local, and used this as a base directory for finding
    images in ODT, EPUB, Docx, and PDF.  This has been confusing to many
    users.  So we now look for images relative to the current
    working directory, even if the first file argument is in another
    directory.   Note that this change may break some existing workflows.
    If you have been assuming that relative links will be interpreted
    relative to the directory of the first file argument, you'll need
    to make that the current directory before running pandoc. (#942)

  * Better error reporting in some readers, due to changes in `readWith`:
    the line in which the error occured is printed, with a caret pointing
    to the column.

  * All slide formats now support incremental slide view for definition lists.

  * Parse `\(..\)` and `\[..\]` as math in MediaWiki reader.
    Parse `:<math>...</math>` as display math.  These notations are used with
    the MathJax MediaWiki extension.

  * All writers: template variables are set automatically from metadata
    fields.  However, variables specified on the command line with
    `--variable` will completely shadow metadata fields.

  * If `--variable` is used to set many variables with the same name,
    a list is created.

  * Man writer:  The `title`, `section`, `header`, and `footer` can now
    all be set individually in metadata.  The `description` variable has been
    removed.  Quotes have been added so that spaces are allowed in the
    title.  If you have a title that begins

        COMMAND(1) footer here | header here

    pandoc will still parse it into a title, section, header, and
    footer.  But you can also specify these elements explicitly (#885).

  * Markdown reader

    + Added support for YAML metadata blocks, which can come anywhere
      in the document (not just at the beginning).  A document can contain
      multiple YAML metadata blocks.
    + HTML span and div tags are parsed as pandoc Span and Div elements.

  * Markdown writer

    + Allow simple tables to be printed as grid tables,
      if other table options are disabled.  This means you can do
      `pandoc -t markdown-pipe_tables-simple_tables-multiline_tables`
      and all tables will render as grid tables.
    + Support YAML title block (render fields in alphabetical order
      to make output predictable).

  [API changes]

  * `Meta` in `Text.Pandoc.Definition` has been changed to allow
    structured metadata.  (Note:  existing code that pattern-matches
    on `Meta` will have to be revised.)  Metadata can now contain
    indefinitely many fields, with content that can be a string,
    a Boolean, a list of `Inline` elements, a list of `Block`
    elements, or a map or list of these.

  * A new generic block container (`Div`) has been added to `Block`,
    and a generic inline container (`Span`) has been added to `Inline`.
    These can take attributes.  They will render in HTML, Textile,
    MediaWiki, Org, RST and and Markdown (with `markdown_in_html`
    extension) as HTML `<div>` and `<span>` elements; in other formats
    they will simply pass through their contents.  But they can be
    targeted by scripts.

  * `Format` is now a newtype, not an alias for String.
    Equality comparisons are case-insensitive.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Walk`, which exports hand-written tree-walking
    functions that are much faster than the SYB functions from
    `Text.Pandoc.Generic`.  These functions are now used where possible
    in pandoc's code.  (`Tests.Walk` verifies that `walk` and `query`
    match the generic traversals `bottomUp` and `queryWith`.)

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.JSON`, which provides `ToJSON` and `FromJSON`
    instances for the basic pandoc types. They use GHC generics and
    should be faster than the old JSON serialization using
    `Data.Aeson.Generic`.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Process`, exporting `pipeProcess`.
    This is a souped-up version of `readProcessWithErrorcode` that
    uses lazy bytestrings instead of strings and allows setting
    environment variables.  (Used in `Text.Pandoc.PDF`.)

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.Readers.OPML`.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.Writers.OPML`.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Haddock` (David Lazar).
    This is based on Haddock's own lexer/parser.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.Writers.Custom`.

  * In `Text.Pandoc.Shared`, `openURL` and `fetchItem` now return an
    Either, for better error handling.

  * Made `stringify` polymorphic in `Text.Pandoc.Shared`.

  * Removed `stripTags` from `Text.Pandoc.XML`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Templates`:

    + Simplified `Template` type to a newtype.
    + Removed `Empty`.
    + Changed type of `renderTemplate`: it now takes a JSON context
      and a compiled template.
    + Export `compileTemplate`.
    + Export `renderTemplate'` that takes a string instead of a compiled
      template.
    + Export `varListToJSON`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.PDF` exports `makePDF` instead of `tex2pdf`.

  * `Text.Pandoc`:

    + Made `toJsonFilter` an alias for `toJSONFilter` from `Text.Pandoc.JSON`.
    + Removed `ToJsonFilter` typeclass.  `ToJSONFilter` from
      `Text.Pandoc.JSON` should be used instead.  (Compiling against
      pandoc-types instead of pandoc will also produce smaller executables.)
    * Removed the deprecated `jsonFilter` function.
    + Added `readJSON`, `writeJSON` to the API (#817).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Options`:

    + Added `Ext_lists_without_preceding_blankline`,
      `Ext_ascii_identifiers`, `Ext_ignore_line_breaks`,
      `Ext_yaml_metadataBlock` to `Extension`.
    + Changed `writerSourceDirectory` to `writerSourceURL` and changed the
      type to a `Maybe`.  `writerSourceURL` is set to 'Just url' when the
      first command-line argument is an absolute URL.  (So, relative links
      will be resolved in relation to the first page.)  Otherwise, 'Nothing'.
    + All bibliography-related fields have been removed from
      `ReaderOptions` and `WriterOptions`: `writerBiblioFiles`,
      `readerReferences`, `readerCitationStyle`.

  * The `Text.Pandoc.Biblio` module has been removed.  Users of the
    pandoc library who want citation support will need to use
    `Text.CSL.Pandoc` from `pandoc-citeproc`.


  [bug fixes]

  * In markdown, don't autolink a bare URI that is followed by `</a>`
    (#937).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`

    + `openURL` now follows redirects (#701), properly handles `data:`
      URIs, and prints diagnostic output to stderr rather than stdout.
    + `readDefaultDataFile`: normalize the paths.  This fixes bugs in
      `--self-contained` on pandoc compiled with `embed_data_files` (#833).
    + Fixed `readDefaultDataFile` so it works on Windows.
    + Better error messages for `readDefaultDataFile`.  Instead of
      listing the last path tried, which can confuse people who are
      using `--self-contained`, so now we just list the data file name.
    + URL-escape pipe characters.  Even though these are legal, `Network.URI`
      doesn't regard them as legal in URLs.  So we escape them first (#535).

  * Mathjax in HTML slide shows:  include explicit "Typeset" call.
    This seems to be needed for some formats (e.g. slideous) and won't
    hurt in others (#966).

  * `Text.Pandoc.PDF`

    + On Windows, create temdir in working directory, since the system
      temp directory path may contain tildes, which can cause
      problems in LaTeX (#777).
    + Put temporary output directory in `TEXINPUTS` (see #917).
    + `makePDF` tries to download images that are not found locally,
      if the first argument is a URL (#917).
    + If compiling with `pdflatex` yields an encoding error, offer
      the suggestion to use `--latex-engine=xelatex`.

  * Produce automatic header identifiers in parsing textile, RST,
    and LaTeX, unless `auto_identifiers` extension is disabled (#967).

  * `Text.Pandoc.SelfContained`:  Strip off fragment, query of relative URL
     before treating as a filename.  This fixes `--self-contained` when used
     with CSS files that include web fonts using the method described here:
      <http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/>
      (#739).  Handle `src` in `embed`, `audio`, `source`, `input` tags.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`: `uri` parser no longer treats punctuation before
    percent-encoding, or a `+` character, as final punctuation.

  * `Text.Pandoc.ImageSize`:  Handle EPS (#903).  This change will make
    EPS images properly sized on conversion to Word.

  * Slidy:  Use slidy.js rather than slidy.js.gz.
    Reason:  some browsers have trouble with the gzipped js file,
    at least on the local file system (#795).

  * Markdown reader

    + Properly handle blank line at beginning of input (#882).
    + Fixed bug in unmatched reference links.  The input
      `[*infile*] [*outfile*]` was getting improperly parsed:
      "infile" was emphasized, but "*outfile*" was literal (#883).
    + Allow internal `+` in citation identifiers (#856).
    + Allow `.` or `)` after `#` in ATX headers if no `fancy_lists`.
    + Do not generate blank title, author, or date metadata elements.
      Leave these out entirely if they aren't present.
    + Allow backtick code blocks not to be preceded by blank line (#975).

  * Textile reader:

    + Correctly handle entities.
    + Improved handling of `<pre>` blocks (#927). Remove internal HTML tags
      in code blocks, rather than printing them verbatim. Parse attributes
      on `<pre>` tag for code blocks.

  * HTML reader: Handle non-simple tables (#893).  Column widths are read from
    `col` tags if present, otherwise divided equally.

  * LaTeX reader

    + Support alltt environment (#892).
    + Support `\textasciitilde`, `\textasciicircum` (#810).
    + Treat `\textsl` as emphasized text reader (#850).
    + Skip positional options after `\begin{figure}`.
    + Support `\v{}` for hacek (#926).
    + Don't add spurious ", " to citation suffixes.
      This is added when needed in pandoc-citeproc.
    + Allow spaces in alignment spec in tables, e.g. `{ l r c }`.
    + Improved support for accented characters (thanks to Scott Morrison).
    + Parse label after section command and set id (#951).

  * RST reader:

    + Don't insert paragraphs where docutils doesn't.
      `rst2html` doesn't add `<p>` tags to list items (even when they are
      separated by blank lines) unless there are multiple paragraphs in the
      list.  This commit changes the RST reader to conform more closely to
      what docutils does (#880).
    + Improved metadata.  Treat initial field list as metadata when
      standalone specified.  Previously ALL fields "title", "author",
      "date" in field lists were treated as metadata, even if not at
      the beginning.  Use `subtitle` metadata field for subtitle.
    + Fixed 'authors' metadata parsing in reST.  Semicolons separate
      different authors.

  * MediaWiki reader

    + Allow space before table rows.
    + Fixed regression for `<ref>URL</ref>`.
      `<` is no longer allowed in URLs, according to the uri parser
      in `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`.  Added a test case.
    + Correctly handle indented preformatted text without preceding
      or following blank line.
    + Fixed `|` links inside table cells.  Improved attribute parsing.
    + Skip attributes on table rows.  Previously we just crashed if
      rows had attributes, now we ignore them.
    + Ignore attributes on headers.
    + Allow `Image:` for images (#971).
    + Parse an image with caption in a paragraph by itself as a figure.

  * LaTeX writer

    + Don't use ligatures in escaping inline code.
    + Fixed footnote numbers in LaTeX/PDF tables.  This fixes a bug
      wherein notes were numbered incorrectly in tables (#827).
    + Always create labels for sections.  Previously the labels were only
      created when there were links to the section in the document (#871).
    + Stop escaping `|` in LaTeX math.
      This caused problems with array environments (#891).
    + Change `\` to `/` in paths.  `/` works even on Windows in LaTeX.
      `\` will cause major problems if unescaped.
    + Write id for code block to label attribute in LaTeX when listings
      is used (thanks to Florian Eitel).
    + Scale LaTeX tables so they don't exceed columnwidth.
    + Avoid problem with footnotes in unnumbered headers (#940).

  * Beamer writer: when creating beamer slides, add `allowframebreaks` option
      to the slide if it is one of the header classes.  It is recommended
      that your bibliography slide have this attribute:

        # References {.allowframebreaks}

    This causes multiple slides to be created if necessary, depending
    on the length of the bibliography.

  * ConTeXt writer: Properly handle tables without captions.  The old output
    only worked in MkII. This should work in MkIV as well (#837).

  * MediaWiki writer: Use native mediawiki tables instead of HTML (#720).

  * HTML writer:

    + Fixed `--no-highlight` (Alexander Kondratskiy).
    + Don't convert to lowercase in email obfuscation (#839).
    + Ensure proper escaping in `<title>` and `<meta>` fields.

  * AsciiDoc writer:

    + Support `--atx-headers` (Max Rydahl Andersen).
    + Don't print empty identifier blocks `([[]])` on headers (Max
      Rydahl Andersen).

  * ODT writer:

    + Fixing wrong numbered-list indentation in open document format
      (Alexander Kondratskiy) (#369).
    + `reference.odt`: Added pandoc as "generator" in `meta.xml`.
    + Minor changes for ODF 1.2 conformance (#939). We leave the
      nonconforming `contextual-spacing` attribute, which is provided by
      LibreOffice itself and seems well supported.

  * Docx writer:

    + Fixed rendering of display math in lists.
      In 1.11 and 1.11.1, display math in lists rendered as a new list
      item.  Now it always appears centered, just as outside of lists,
      and in proper display math style, no matter how far indented the
      containing list item is (#784).
    + Use `w:br` with `w:type` `textWrapping` for linebreaks.
      Previously we used `w:cr` (#873).
    + Use Compact style for Plain block elements, to
      differentiate between tight and loose lists (#775).
    + Ignore most components of `reference.docx`.
      We take the `word/styles.xml`, `docProps/app.xml`,
      `word/theme/theme1.xml`, and `word/fontTable.xml` from
      `reference.docx`, ignoring everything else.  This should help
      with the corruption problems caused when different versions of
      Word resave the reference.docx and reorganize things.
    +  Made `--no-highlight` work properly.

  * EPUB writer

    + Don't add `dc:creator` tags if present in EPUB metadata.
    + Add `id="toc-title"` to `h1` in `nav.xhtml` (#799).
    + Don't put blank title page in reading sequence.
      Set `linear="no"` if no title block.  Addresses #797.
    + Download webtex images and include as data URLs.
      This allows you to use `--webtex` in creating EPUBs.
      Math with `--webtex` is automatically made self-contained.
    + In `data/epub.css`, removed highlighting styles (which
      are no longer needed, since styles are added by the HTML
      writer according to `--highlighting-style`).  Simplified
      margin fields.
    + If resource not found, skip it, as in Docx writer (#916).

  * RTF writer:

    + Properly handle characters above the 0000-FFFF range.
      Uses surrogate pairs.  Thanks to Hiromi Ishii for the patch.
    + Fixed regression with RTF table of contents.
    + Only autolink absolute URIs.  This fixes a regression, #830.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Only autolink absolute URIs.  This fixes a regression, #830.
    + Don't wrap attributes in fenced code blocks.
    + Write full metadata in MMD style title blocks.
    + Put multiple authors on separate lines in pandoc titleblock.
      Also, don't wrap long author entries, as new lines get treated
      as new authors.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Templates`:

    + Fixed bug retrieving default template for markdown variants.
    + Templates can now contain "record lookups" in variables;
      for example, `author.institution` will retrieve the `institution`
      field of the `author` variable.
    + More consistent behavior of `$for$`.  When `foo` is not a list,
      `$for(foo)$...$endfor$` should behave like $if(foo)$...$endif$.
      So if `foo` resolves to "", no output should be produced.
      See pandoc-templates#39.

  * Citation processing improvements (now part of pandoc-citeproc):

    + Fixed `endWithPunct` The new version correctly sees a sentence
      ending in '.)' as ending with punctuation.  This fixes a bug which
      led such sentences to receive an extra period at the end: '.).'.
      Thanks to Steve Petersen for reporting.
    + Don't interfere with Notes that aren't citation notes.
      This fixes a bug in which notes not generated from citations were
      being altered (e.g. first letter capitalized) (#898).
    + Only capitalize footnote citations when they have a prefix.
    + Changes in suffix parsing.  A suffix beginning with a digit gets 'p'
      inserted before it before passing to citeproc-hs, so that bare numbers
      are treated as page numbers by default.  A suffix not beginning with
      punctuation has a space added at the beginning (rather than a comma and
      space, as was done before for not-author-in-text citations).
      The result is that `\citep[23]{item1}` in LaTeX will be interpreted
      properly, with '23' treated as a locator of type 'page'.
    + Many improvements to citation rendering, due to fixes in citeproc-hs
      (thanks to Andrea Rossato).
    + Warnings are issued for undefined citations, which are rendered
      as `???`.
    + Fixed hanging behavior when locale files cannot be found.

  [template changes]

  * DocBook:  Use DocBook 4.5 doctype.

  * Org: '#+TITLE:' is inserted before the title.
    Previously the writer did this.

  * LaTeX:  Changes to make mathfont work with xelatex.
    We need the mathspec library, not just fontspec, for this.
    We also need to set options for setmathfont (#734).

  * LaTeX: Use `tex-ansi` mapping for `monofont`.
    This ensures that straight quotes appear as straight, rather than
    being treated as curly.  See #889.

  * Made `\includegraphics` more flexible in LaTeX template.
    Now it can be used with options, if needed.  Thanks to Bernhard Weichel.

  * LaTeX/Beamer: Added `classoption` variable.
    This is intended for class options like `oneside`; it may
    be repeated with different options.  (Thanks to Oliver Matthews.)

  * Beamer: Added `fonttheme` variable.  (Thanks to Luis Osa.)

  * LaTeX: Added `biblio-style` variable (#920).

  * DZSlides: title attribute on title section.

  * HTML5: add meta tag to allow scaling by user (Erik Evenson)

  [under-the-hood improvements]

  * Markdown reader:Improved strong/emph parsing, using the strategy of
    <https://github.com/jgm/Markdown>.  The new parsing algorithm requires
    no backtracking, and no keeping track of nesting levels.  It will give
    different results in some edge cases, but these should not affect normal
    uses.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Compat.Monoid`.
    This allows pandoc to compile with `base` < 4.5, where `Data.Monoid`
    doesn't export `<>`.  Thanks to Dirk Ullirch for the patch.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Compat.TagSoupEntity`.
    This allows pandoc to compile with `tagsoup` 0.13.x.
    Thanks to Dirk Ullrich for the patch.

  * Most of `Text.Pandoc.Readers.TeXMath` has been moved to the
    `texmath` module (0.6.4).  (This allows `pandoc-citeproc` to
    handle simple math in bibliography fields.)

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.Shared` for shared functions used
    only in writers.  `metaToJSON` is used in writers to create a
    JSON object for use in the templates from the pandoc metadata
    and variables.  `getField`, `setField`, and `defField` are
    for working with JSON template contexts.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Asciify` utility module.
    This exports functions to create ASCII-only versions of identifiers.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`

    + Generalized state type on `readWith` (API change).
    + Specialize readWith to `String` input. (API change).
    + In `ParserState`, replace `stateTitle`, `stateAuthors`, `stateDate`
      with `stateMeta` and `stateMeta'`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8`: use strict bytestrings in reading.  The use of lazy
     bytestrings seemed to cause problems using pandoc on 64-bit Windows
     7/8 (#874).

  * Factored out `registerHeader` from markdown reader, added to
    `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`.

  * Removed `blaze_html_0_5` flag, require `blaze-html` >= 0.5.
    Reason:  < 0.5 does not provide a monoid instance for Attribute,
    which is now needed by the HTML writer (#803).

  * Added `http-conduit` flag, which allows fetching https resources.
    It also brings in a large number of dependencies (`http-conduit`
    and its dependencies), which is why for now it is an optional flag
    (#820).

  * Added CONTRIBUTING.md.

  * Improved INSTALL instructions.

  * `make-windows-installer.bat`: Removed explicit paths for executables.

  * `aeson` is now used instead of `json` for JSON.

  * Set default stack size to 16M.  This is needed for some large
    conversions, esp. if pandoc is compiled with 64-bit ghc.

  * Various small documentation improvements.
    Thanks to achalddave and drothlis for patches.

  * Removed comment that chokes recent versions of CPP (#933).

  * Removed support for GHC version < 7.2, since pandoc-types now
    requires at least GHC 7.2 for GHC generics.


pandoc (1.11.1)

  * Markdown reader:

    + Fixed regression in which parentheses were lost in link URLs.
      Added tests.  Closes #786.
    + Better handling of unmatched double quotes in `--smart` mode.
      These occur frequently in fiction, since it is customary not to
      close quotes in dialogue if the speaker does not change between
      paragraphs.  The unmatched quotes now get turned into literal
      left double quotes. (No `Quoted` inline is generated, however.)
      Closes #99 (again).

  * HTML writer: Fixed numbering mismatch between TOC and sections.
    `--number-offset` now affects TOC numbering as well
    as section numbering, as it should have all along.  Closes #789.

  * Markdown writer: Reverted 1.11 change that caused citations to be rendered
    as markdown citations, even if `--bibliography` was specified, unless
    `citation` extension is disabled.  Now, formatted citations are always
    printed if `--bibliography` was specified.  If you want to reformat
    markdown keeping pandoc markdown citations intact, don't use
    `--bibliography`.  Note that citations parsed from LaTeX documents will
    be rendered as pandoc markdown citations when `--bibliography` is not
    specified.

  * ODT writer: Fixed regression leading to corrupt ODTs.
    This was due to a change in the `Show` instance for
    `Text.Pandoc.Pretty.Doc`.  Closes #780.

  * Fixed spacing bugs involving code block attributes in
    RST reader and Markdown writer. Closes #763.

  * Windows package:  Various improvements due to Fyodor Sheremetyev.

    + Automatically set installation path (Program Files or Local App Data).
    + Set system PATH environment variable when installing for all users.
    + Pandoc can installed for all users using the following command.
      `msiexec /i pandoc-1.11.msi ALLUSERS=1`.

  * Bumped QuickCheck version bound.

pandoc (1.11)

  * Added `--number-offset` option.  (See README for description.)

  * Added `--default-image-extension` option.  (See README for description.)

  * `--number-sections` behavior change: headers with class `unnumbered`
    will not be numbered.

  * `--version` now reports the default data directory.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing` is no longer exposed. (API change.)

  * `Text.Pandoc.Highlighting` is no longer exposed. (API change.)

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:  Changed type of `Element`.  `Sec` now includes
    a field for `Attr` rather than just `String`.  (API change.)

  * Added `markdown_github` as input format.  This was an accidental
    omission in 1.10.

  * Added `readerDefaultImageExtension` field to `ReaderOptions`.  (API
    change.)

  * Added `writerNumberOffset` field in `WriterOptions`. (API change.)

  * Beamer template:

    + Fixed captions with longtable.  Thanks to Joost Kremers.
    + Provide `\Oldincludegraphics` as in LaTeX template (Benjamin Bannier).

  * LaTeX template:

    + Load microtype after fonts.  Microtype needs to know
      what fonts are being used.  Thanks to dfc for the patch.
    + Set `secnumdepth` to 5 if `--number-sections` specified.
      This yields behavior equivalent to the other writers, numbering
      level 4 and 5 headers too.  Closes #753.

  * HTML reader:

    + Handle `<colgroup>` tag.
    + Preserve all header attributes.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Parse `\hrule` as `HorizontalRule`.  Closes #746.
    + Parse starred variants of `\section` etc. as headers with
      attribute `unnumbered`.
    + Read optional attributes in `lstlisting` and `Verbatim` environments.
      We convert these to pandoc standard names, e.g. `numberLines`
      for `numbers=left`, `startFrom=100` from `firstnumber=100`.
    + Handle language attribute for lstlistings.
    + Better support for Verbatim and minted environments.  Closes #763.

  * Markdown reader:

    + `-` in an attribute context = `.unnumbered`.  The point of this
      is to provide a way to specify unnumbered headers in non-English
      documents.
    + Fixed bug parsing key/value attributes.  Parsing failed if you
      had an unquoted attribute immediately before the final '}'.
    + Make backslash escape work in attributes.
    + Fix title block parsing.  Now if `mmd_title_blocks` is specified,
      pandoc will parse a MMD title block if it sees one, even if
      `pandoc_title_blocks` is enabled.
    + Refactoring: `litChar` now includes entities, so we don't need
      to use `fromEntities` e.g. on titles.
    + Allow spaces around borders in pipe tables.  Closes #772.
    + Allow all punctuation in angle-bracket autolinks.  Previously
      things like `----` were disallowed, because the uri parser
      treated them as trailing punctuation.  Closes #768.
    + Make `implicit_header_references` work properly when
      headers are given explicit identifiers.
    + Check for tables before line blocks.  Otherwise some pipe
      tables get treated as line blocks.
    + Allow `&` in emails (for entities).
    + Properly handle entities in titles and links.  A markdown link
      `<http://g&ouml;ogle.com>` should be a link to `http://göogle.com`.
      Closes #723.

  * Textile reader:

    + Handle attributes on headers.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Add `fig:` as title for images with captions.
      This is needed for them to be rendered as figures.  Closes #766.
    + Never emit an empty paragraph.  See #761.
    + Handle `\caption` for images in figures.  Closes #766.
    + Parse `\section*`, etc. as unnumbered sections.

  * HTML writer:

    + Support header attributes.  The attributes go on
      the enclosing `section` or `div` tag if `--section-divs` is specified.
    + Fixed a regression (only now noticed) in html+lhs output.
      Previously the bird tracks were being omitted.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Omit lists with no items to avoid LaTeX errors.
    + Support line numbering with `--listings`.
      If `numberLines` class is present, we add `numbers=left`;
      if `startFrom` is present, we add `firstnumber=`. (#763)

  * ConTeXt writer:

    + Removed `\placecontent`.  This produced a duplicate toc,
      in conjunction with `\placelist`.
    + Use `\title`, `\subject` etc. for headers with
      `unnumbered` class.

  * Textile writer:

    + Support header attributes.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Use grid tables when needed, and if enabled.  Closes #740.
    + Render citations as pandoc-markdown citations.
      Previously citations were rendered as citeproc-formatted citations
      by default.  Now we render them as pandoc citations, e.g. `[@item1]`,
      unless the `citations` extension is disabled.
      If you still want formatted citations in your markdown output,
      use `pandoc -t markdown-citations`.

  * RST writer:

    + Support `:number-lines:` in code blocks.

  * Docx writer:

    + Better treatment of display math.  Display math inside a
      paragraph is now put in a separate paragraph, so it will render
      properly (centered and without extra blank lines around it).
      Partially addresses #742.
    + Content types and document rels xml files are now created from
      scratch, rather than being taken over from `reference.docx`.
      This fixes problems that arise when you edit the `reference.docx`
      with Word.
    + We also now encode mime types for each individual image rather
      than using defaults.  This should allow us to handle a wider
      range of image types (including PDF).   Closes #414.
    + Changed style names in `reference docx`.
      `FootnoteReference` -> `FootnoteRef`, `Hyperlink` -> `Link`.
      The old names got changed by Word when the `reference.docx` was
      edited.  Closes #414.

  * EPUB writer:

    + Fix section numbering.  Previously the numbering restarted from 1
      in each chapter (with `--number-sections`), though the numbers in
      the table of contents were correct.
    + Headers with "unnumbered" attribute are not numbered.  (Nor do they
      cause an increment in running numbering.) Section numbers now work
      properly, even when there is material before the first numbered section.
    + Include HTML TOC, even in epub2.  The TOC is included in `<spine>`,
      but `linear` is set to `no` unless the `--toc` option is specified.
      Include `<guide>` element in OPF.  This should allow the TOC to
      be useable in Kindles when converted with kindlegen. Closes #773.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`: Optimized `oneOfStringsCI`.
    This dramatically reduces the speed penalty that comes from enabling the
    `autolink_bare_uris` extension.  The penalty is still substantial (in one
    test, from 0.33s to 0.44s), but nowhere near what it used to be.
    The RST reader is also much faster now, as it autodetects URIs.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:  `hierarchicalize` will not number section
    with class "unnumbered".  Unnumbered sections get `[]` for their
    section number.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Pretty`:

    + Fixed `chomp` so it works inside `Prefixed` elements.
    + Changed `Show` instance so it is better for debugging.

  * `Text.Pandoc.ImageSize`:  Added `Pdf` to `ImageType`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8`:  Strip off BOM if present.  Closes #743.

  * Windows installer improvements:

    + The installer is now signed with a certificate (thanks to
      Fyodor Sheremetyev).
    + WiX is used instead of InnoSetup.  The installer is now a
      standard msi file.
    + The version number is now auto-detected, and need not be
      updated separately.

  * OSX installer improvements:

    + The package and pandoc executable are now signed with a
      certificate (thanks to Fyodor Sheremetyev).
    + RTF version of license is used.
    + Use full path for sysctl in `InstallationCheck` script (jonahbull).
      Closes #580.

  * Converted COPYING to markdown.

  * pandoc.cabal:  Require latest versions of highlighting-kate,
    texmath, citeproc-hs, zip-archive.

pandoc (1.10.1)

  * Markdown reader:  various optimizations, leading to a
    significant performance boost.

  * RST reader:  Allow anonymous form of inline links:
    `` `hello <url>`__ `` Closes #724.

  * Mediawiki reader: Don't require newlines after tables.
    Thanks to jrunningen for the patch. Closes #733.

  * Fixed LaTeX macro parsing.  Now LaTeX macro definitions are preserved
    when output is LaTeX, and applied when it is another format.
    Partially addresses #730.

  * Markdown and RST readers:  Added parser to `block` that skips blank
    lines.  This fixes a subtle regression involving grid tables with
    empty cells.  Also added test for grid table with empty cells.
    Closes #732.

  * RST writer:  Use `.. code:: language` for code blocks with language.
    Closes #721.

  * DocBook writer:  Fixed output for hard line breaks, adding a newline
    between `<literallayout>` tags.

  * Markdown writer:  Use an autolink when link text matches url.
    Previously we also checked for a null title, but this
    test fails for links produced by citeproc-hs in bibliographies.
    So, if the link has a title, it will be lost on conversion
    to an autolink, but that seems okay.

  * Markdown writer:  Set title, author, date variables as before.
    These are no longer used in the default template, since we use
    titleblock, but we set them anyway for those who use custom templates.

  * LaTeX writer:  Avoid extra space at start/end of table cell.
    Thanks to Nick Bart for the suggestion of using @{}.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + More efficient version of `anyLine`.
    + Type of `macro` has changed; the parser now returns `Blocks`
      instead of `Block`.

  * Relaxed old-time version bound, allowing 1.0.*.

  * Removed obsolete `hsmarkdown` script.  Those who need `hsmarkdown`
    should create a symlink as described in the README.

pandoc (1.10.0.5)

  * Markdown reader: Try `lhsCodeBlock` before `rawTeXBlock`.  Otherwise
    `\begin{code}...\end{code}` isn't handled properly in markdown+lhs.
    Thanks to Daniel Miot for noticing the bug and suggesting the fix.

  * Markdown reader: Fixed bug with headerless grid tables.
    The 1.10 code assumed that each table header cell contains exactly one
    block. That failed for headerless tables (0) and also for tables with
    multiple blocks in a header cell.  The code is fixed and tests provided.
    Thanks to Andrew Lee for pointing out the bug.

  * Markdown reader: Fixed regressions in fenced code blocks. Closes #722.

    + Tilde code fences can again take a bare language string
      (`~~~ haskell`), not just curly-bracketed attributes
      (`~~~ {.haskell}`).
    + Backtick code blocks can take the curly-bracketed attributes.
    + Backtick code blocks don't *require* a language.
    + Consolidated code for the two kinds of fenced code blocks.

  * LaTeX template: Use `\urlstyle{same}` to avoid monospace URLs.

  * Markdown writer: Use proportional font for email autolinks with
    obfuscation.  Closes #714.

  * Corrected name of `blank_before_blockquote` in README.  Closes #718.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`: Fixed bug in `uri` parser.
    The bug prevented an autolink at the end of a string (e.g.
    at the end of a line block line) from counting as a link.  Closes #711.

  * Use the `hsb2hs` preprocessor instead of TH for embed_data_files.
    This should work on Windows, unlike the TH solution with
    file-embed.

  * Eliminated use of TH in test suite.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Data` (non-exported) to hold the association
    list of embedded data files, if the `embed_data_files` flag is selected.
    This isolates the code that needs special treatment with file-embed or
    `hsb2hs`.

  * Changes to `make-windows-installer.bat`.

    + Exit batch file if any of the cabal-dev installs fail.
    + There's no longer any need to reinstall `highlighting-kate`.
    + Don't start with a `cabal update`; leave that to the user.
    + Force reinstall of pandoc.

  * Fixed EPUB writer so it builds with blaze-html 0.4.x. Thanks to
    Jens Petersen.

pandoc (1.10.0.4)

  * Fixed bug with escaped % in LaTeX reader. Closes #710.

pandoc (1.10.0.3)

  * Added further missing fb2 tests to cabal file.

pandoc (1.10.0.2)

  * Added fb2 tests to cabal file's extra-source-files.

pandoc (1.10.0.1)

  * Bump version bounds on test-framework packages.

pandoc (1.10)

  [new features]

  * New input formats:  `mediawiki` (MediaWiki markup).

  * New output formats:  `epub3` (EPUB v3 with MathML),
    `fb2` (FictionBook2 ebooks).

  * New `--toc-depth` option, specifying how many levels of
    headers to include in a table of contents.

  * New `--epub-chapter-level` option, specifying the header
    level at which to divide EPUBs into separate files.
    Note that this normally affects only performance, not the
    visual presentation of the EPUB in a reader.

  * Removed the `--strict` option.  Instead of using `--strict`,
    one can now use the format name `markdown_strict` for either input
    or output.  This gives more fine-grained control that `--strict`
    did, allowing one to convert from pandoc's markdown to strict
    markdown or vice versa.

  * It is now possible to enable or disable specific syntax
    extensions by appending them (with `+` or `-`) to the writer
    or reader name.  For example,

        pandoc -f markdown-footnotes+hard_line_breaks

    disables footnotes and enables treating newlines as hard
    line breaks.  The literate Haskell extensions are now implemented
    this way as well, using either `+lhs` or `+literate_haskell`.
    For a list of extension names, see the README under
    "Pandoc's Markdown."

  * The following aliases have been introduced for specific
    combinations of markdown extensions:  `markdown_phpextra`,
    `markdown_github`, `markdown_mmd`, `markdown_strict`.  These aliases
    work just like regular reader and writer names, and can be modified
    with extension modifiers as described above. (Note that conversion
    from one markdown dialect to another does not work perfectly,
    because there are differences in markdown parsers besides
    just the extensions, and because pandoc's internal document model is
    not rich enough to capture all of the extensions.)

  * New `--html-q-tags` option.  The previous default was to use `<q>`
    tags for smart quotes in HTML5.  But `<q>` tags are also valid HTML4.
    Moreover, they are not a robust way of typesetting quotes, since
    some user agents don't support them, and some CSS resets (e.g.
    bootstrap) prevent pandoc's quotes CSS from working properly.
    We now just insert literal quote characters by default in both
    `html` and `html5` output, but this option is provided for
    those who still want `<q>` tags.

  * The markdown reader now prints warnings (to stderr) about
    duplicate link and note references.  Closes #375.

  * Markdown syntax extensions:

    + Added pipe tables.  Thanks to François Gannaz for the initial patch.
      These conform to PHP Markdown Extra's pipe table syntax. A subset
      of org-mode table syntax is also supported, which means that you can
      use org-mode's nice table editor to create tables.

    + Added support for RST-style line blocks. These are
      useful for verse and addresses.

    + Attributes can now be specified for headers, using the same
      syntax as in code blocks.  (However, currently only the
      identifier has any effect in most writers.)  For example,

            # My header {#foo}

            See [the header above](#foo).

    + Pandoc will now act as if link references have been defined
      for all headers without explicit identifiers.
      So, you can do this:

            # My header

            Link to [My header].
            Another link to [it][My header].

      Closes #691.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Command macros now work everywhere, including non-math.
      Environment macros still not supported.
    + `\input` now works, as well as `\include`.  TEXINPUTS is used.
      Pandoc looks recursively into included files for more included files.

  [behavior changes]

  * The Markdown reader no longer puts the text of autolinks in a
    `Code` inline.  This means that autolinks will no longer appear
    in a monospace font.

  * The character `/` can now appear in markdown citation keys.

  * HTML blocks in strict_markdown are no longer required to begin
    at the left margin.  Technically this is required, according to
    the markdown syntax document, but `Markdown.pl` and other markdown
    processors are more liberal.

  * The `-V` option has been changed so that if there are duplicate
    variables, those specified later on the command line take precedence.

  * Tight lists now work in LaTeX and ConTeXt output.

  * The LaTeX writer no longer relien on the `enumerate` package.
    Instead, it uses standard LaTeX commands to change the list numbering
    style.

  * The LaTeX writer now uses `longtable` instead of `ctable`. This allows
    tables to be split over page boundaries.

  * The RST writer now uses a line block to render paragraphs containing
    linebreaks (which previously weren't supported at all).

  * The markdown writer now applies the `--id-prefix` to footnote IDs.
    Closes #614.

  * The plain writer no longer uses backslash-escaped line breaks
    (which are not very "plain").

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8`: Better error message for invalid UTF8.
    Read bytestring and use `Text`'s decodeUtf8 instead of using
    `System.IO.hGetContents`.  This way you get a message saying
    "invalid UTF-8 stream" instead of "invalid byte sequence."
    You are also told which byte caused the problem.

  * Docx, ODT, and EPUB writers now download images specified by a URL
    instead of skipping them or raising an error.

  * EPUB writer:

    + The default CSS now left-aligns headers by default, instead of
      centering.  This is more consistent with the rest of the writers.
    + A proper multi-level table of contents is now used in `toc.ncx`.
      There is no longer a subsidiary table of contents at the beginning
      of each chapter.
    + Code highlighting now works by default.
    + Section divs are used by default for better semantic markup.
    + The title is used instead of "Title Page" in the table of contents.
      Otherwise we have a hard-coded English string, which looks
      strange in ebooks written in other languages.  Closes #572.

  * HTML writer:

    + Put mathjax in span with class "math".  Closes #562.
    + Put citations in a span with class "citation." In HTML5, also include
      a `data-cite` attribute with a space-separated list of citation
      keys.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8`:  use universalNewlineMode in reading.
    This treats both `\r\n` and `\n` as `\n` on input, no matter
    what platform we're running on.

  * Citation processing is now done in the Markdown and LaTeX
    readers, not in `pandoc.hs`.  This makes it easier for library users
    to use citations.

  [template changes]

  * HTML: Added css to template to preserve spaces in `<code>` tags.
    Thanks to Dirk Laurie.

  * Beamer:  Remove English-centric strings in section pages.
    Section pages used to have "Section" and a number as well as the
    section title. Now they just have the title.  Similarly for part
    and subsection.  Closes #566.

  * LaTeX, ConTeXt: Added papersize variable.

  * LaTeX, Beamer templates: Use longtable instead of ctable.

  * LaTeX, Beamer templates: Don't require 'float' package for tables.
    We don't actually seem to use the '[H]' option.

  * LaTeX:  Use `upquote` package if it is available.  This fixes
    straight quotes in verbatim environments.

  * Markdown, plain: Fixed titleblock so it is just a single string.
    Previously separate title, author, and date variables were used,
    but this didn't allow different kinds of title blocks.

  * EPUB:

    + Rationalized templates.  Previously there were three different
      templates involved in epub production. There is now just one
      template, `default.epub` or `default.epub3`. It can now be
      overridden using `--template`, just like other templates.
      The titlepage is now folded into the default template.
      A `titlepage` variable selects it.
    + UTF-8, lang tag, meta tags, title element.

  * Added scale-to-width feature to beamer template

  [API changes]

  * `Text.Pandoc.Definition`: Added `Attr` field to `Header`.
    Previously header identifers were autogenerated by the writers.
    Now they are added in the readers (either automatically or explicitly).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Builder`:

    + `Inlines` and `Blocks` are now synonyms for `Many Inline` and
      `Many Block`.  `Many` is a newtype wrapper around `Seq`, with
      custom Monoid instances for `Many Inline` and `Many Block.  This
      allows `Many` to be made an instance of `Foldable` and `Traversable`.
    + The old `Listable` class has been removed.
    + The module now exports `isNull`, `toList`, `fromList`.
    + The old `Read` and `Show` instances have been removed; derived
      instances are now used.
    + Added `headerWith`.

  * The readers now take a `ReaderOptions` rather than a `ParserState`
    as a parameter.  Indeed, not all parsers use the `ParserState` type;
    some have a custom state.  The motivation for this change was to separate
    user-specifiable options from the accounting functions of parser state.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.Options`.  This includes the `WriterOptions`
    formerly in `Text.Pandoc.Shared`, and its associated
    data types.  It also includes a new type `ReaderOptions`, which
    contains many options formerly in `ParserState`, and its associated
    data types:

    + `ParserState.stateParseRaw` -> `ReaderOptions.readerParseRaw`.
    + `ParserState.stateColumns` -> `ReaderOptions.readerColumns`.
    + `ParserState.stateTabStop` -> `ReaderOptions.readerTabStop`.
    + `ParserState.stateOldDashes` -> `ReaderOptions.readerOldDashes`.
    + `ParserState.stateLiterateHaskell` -> `ReaderOptions.readerLiterateHaskell`.
    + `ParserState.stateCitations` -> `ReaderOptions.readerReferences`.
    + `ParserState.stateApplyMacros` -> `ReaderOptions.readerApplyMacros`.
    + `ParserState.stateIndentedCodeClasses` ->
      `ReaderOptions.readerIndentedCodeClasses`.
    + Added `ReaderOptions.readerCitationStyle`.

  * `WriterOptions` now includes `writerEpubVersion`, `writerEpubChapterLevel`,
    `writerEpubStylesheet`, `writerEpubFonts`, `writerReferenceODT`,
    `writerReferenceDocx`, and `writerTOCDepth`.  `writerEPUBMetadata` has
    been renamed `writerEpubMetadata` for consistency.

  * Changed signatures of `writeODT`, `writeDocx`, `writeEPUB`, since they no
    longer stylesheet, fonts, reference files as separate parameters.

  * Removed `writerLiterateHaskell` from `WriterOptions`, and
    `readerLiterateHaskell` from `ReaderOptions`.  LHS is now handled
    by an extension (`Ext_literate_haskell`).

  * Removed deprecated `writerXeTeX`.

  * Removed `writerStrict` from `WriterOptions`.  Added `writerExtensions`.
    Strict is now handled through extensions.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Options` exports `pandocExtensions`, `strictExtensions`,
    `phpMarkdownExtraExtensions`, `githubMarkdownExtensions`,
    and `multimarkdownExtensions`, as well as the `Extensions` type.

  * New `Text.Pandoc.Readers.MediaWiki` module, exporting
    `readMediaWiki`.

  * New `Text.Pandoc.Writers.FB2` module, exporting `writeFB2`
    (thanks to Sergey Astanin).

  * `Text.Pandoc`:

    + Added `getReader`, `getWriter` to `Text.Pandoc`.
    + `writers` is now an association list `(String, Writer)`.
      A `Writer` can be a `PureStringWriter`, an `IOStringWriter`, or
      an `IOByteStringWriter`.  ALL writers are now in the 'writers'
      list, including the binary writers and FB2 writer.  This allows
      code in `pandoc.hs` to be simplified.
    + Changed type of `readers`, so all readers are in IO.
      Users who want pure readers can still get them form the reader
      modules; this just affects the function `getReader` that looks up
      a reader based on the format name.  The point of this change is to
      make it possible to print warnings from the parser.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + `Text.Parsec` now exports all Parsec functions used in pandoc code.
      No other module directly imports Parsec.  This will make it easier
      to change the parsing backend in the future, if we want to.
    + `Text.Parsec` is used instead of `Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec`.
    + Export the type synonym `Parser`.
    + Export `widthsFromIndices`, `NoteTable'`, `KeyTable'`, `Key'`, `toKey'`,
     `withQuoteContext`, `singleQuoteStart`, `singleQuoteEnd`,
     `doubleQuoteStart`, `doubleQuoteEnd`, `ellipses`, `apostrophe`,
     `dash`, `nested`, `F(..)`, `askF`, `asksF`, `runF`, `lineBlockLines`.
    + `ParserState` is no longer an instance of `Show`.
    + Added `stateSubstitutions` and `stateWarnings` to `ParserState`.
    + Generalized type of `withQuoteContext`.
    + Added `guardEnabled`, `guardDisabled`, `getOption`.
    + Removed `failIfStrict`.
    + `lookupKeySrc` and `fromKey` are no longer exported.

  * `Data.Default` instances are now provided for `ReaderOptions`,
    `WriterOptions`, and `ParserState`.  `Text.Pandoc` re-exports `def`.
    Now you can use `def` (which is re-exported by `Text.Pandoc`) instead
    of `defaultWriterOptions` (which is still defined).  Closes #546.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:

    + Added `safeRead`.
    + Renamed `removedLeadingTrailingSpace` to `trim`,
      `removeLeadingSpace` to `triml`, and `removeTrailingSpace` to `trimr`.
    + Count `\r` as space in `trim` functions.
    + Moved `renderTags'` from HTML reader and `Text.Pandoc.SelfContained`
      to `Shared`.
    + Removed `failUnlessLHS`.
    + Export `compactify'`, formerly in Markdown reader.
    + Export `isTightList`.
    + Do not export `findDataFile`.
    + `readDataFile` now returns a strict ByteString.
    + Export `readDataFileUTF8` which returns a String, like the
      old `readDataFile`.
    + Export `fetchItem` and `openURL`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.ImageSize`: Use strict, not lazy bytestrings.
    Removed `readImageSize`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8`: Export `encodePath`, `decodePath`,
     `decodeArg`, `toString`, `fromString`, `toStringLazy`,
     `fromStringLazy`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8` is now an exposed module.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Biblio`:

    + csl parameter now a `String` rather than a `FilePath`.
    + Changed type of `processBiblio`.  It is no longer in the IO monad.
      It now takes a `Maybe Style` argument rather than parameters for CSL
      and abbrev filenames.  (`pandoc.hs` now calls the functions to parse
      the style file and add abbreviations.)

  * Markdown reader now exports `readMarkdownWithWarnings`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.RTF` now exports `writeRTFWithEmbeddedImages` instead of
    `rtfEmbedImage`.

  [bug fixes]

  * Make `--ascii` work properly with `--self-contained`.  Closes #568.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Fixed link parser to avoid exponential slowdowns.  Closes #620.
      Previously the parser would hang on input like this:

            [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[hi

      We fixed this by making the link parser parser characters
      between balanced brackets (skipping brackets in inline code spans),
      then parsing the result as an inline list.  One change is that

            [hi *there]* bud](/url)

      is now no longer parsed as a link.  But in this respect pandoc behaved
      differently from most other implementations anyway, so that seems okay.

    + Look for raw html/latex blocks before tables.
      Otherwise the following gets parsed as a table:

            \begin{code}
            --------------
            -- My comment.
            \end{code}

      Closes #578.

  * RST reader:

    + Added support for `:target:` on `.. image::` blocks
      and substitutions.
    + Field list fixes:

        - Fixed field lists items with body beginning after a new line
          (Denis Laxalde).
        - Allow any char but ':' in names of field lists in RST reader
          (Denis Laxalde).
        - Don't allow line breaks in field names.
        - Require whitespace after field list field names.
        - Don't create empty definition list for metadata field lists.
          Previously a field list consisting only of metadata fields (author,
          title, date) would be parsed as an empty DefinitionList, which is
          not legal in LaTeX and not needed in any format.

    + Don't recognize inline-markup starts inside words.
      For example, `2*2 = 4*1` should not contain an emphasized
      section.  Added test case for "Literal symbols".  Closes #569.
    + Allow dashes as separator in simple tables.  Closes #555.
    + Added support for `container`, `compound`, `epigraph`,
      `rubric`, `highlights`, `pull-quote`.
    + Added support for `.. code::`.
    + Made directive labels case-insensitive.
    + Removed requirement that directives begin at left margin.
      This was (correctly) not in earlier releases; docutils doesn't
      make the requirement.
    + Added support for `replace::` and `unicode::` substitutions.
    + Ignore unknown interpreted roles.
    + Renamed image parser to `subst`, since it now handles all
      substitution references.

  * Textile reader:

    + Allow newlines before pipes in table.  Closes #654.
    + Fixed bug with list items containing line breaks.
      Now pandoc correctly handles hard line breaks inside list items.
      Previously they broke list parsing.
    + Implemented comment blocks.
    + Fixed bug affected words ending in hyphen.
    + Properly handle links with surrounding brackets.
      Square brackets need to be used when the link isn't surrounded by
      spaces or punctuation, or when the URL ending may be ambiguous.
      Closes #564.
    + Removed nullBlock.  Better to know about parsing problems than
      to skip stuff when we get stuck.
    + Allow ID attributes on headers.
    + Textile reader:  Avoid parsing dashes as strikeout.
      Previously the input

            text--
            text--
            text--
            text--

      would be parsed with strikeouts rather than dashes. This fixes
      the problem by requiring that a strikeout delimiting - not be
      followed by a -.  Closes #631.
    + Expanded list of `stringBreakers`.
      This fixes a bug on input like "(_hello_)" which should
      be a parenthesized emphasized "hello".
      The new list is taken from the PHP source of textile 2.4.
    + Fixed autolinks.  Previously the textile reader and writer
      incorrectly implented RST-style autolinks for URLs and email
      addresses.  This has been fixed.  Now an autolink is done this way:
      `"$":http://myurl.com`.
    + Fixed footnotes bug in textile.  This affected notes occuring
      before punctuation, e.g. `foo[1].`.  Closes #518.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Better handling of citation commands.
    + Better handling of `\noindent`.
    + Added a 'try' in rawLaTeXBlock, so we can handle `\begin` without `{`.
      Closes #622.
    + Made `rawLaTeXInline` try to parse block commands as well.  This
      is usually what we want, given how `rawLaTeXInline` is used in
      the markdown and textile readers.  If a block-level LaTeX command
      is used in the middle of a paragraph (e.g. `\subtitle` inside a title),
      we can treat it as raw inline LaTeX.
    + Handle \slash command.  Closes #605.
    + Basic `\enquote` support.
    + Fixed parsing of paragraphs beginning with a group.  Closes #606.
    + Use curly quotes for bare straight quotes.
    + Support obeylines environment.  Closes #604.
    + Guard against "begin", "end" in inlineCommand and
      blockCommand.
    + Better error messages for environments.  Now it should tell you that
      it was looking for \end{env}, instead of giving "unknown parse error."

  * HTML reader:

    + Added HTML 5 tags to list of block-level tags.
    + HTML reader: Fixed bug in `htmlBalanced`, which
      caused hangs in parsing certain markdown input using
      strict mode.
    + Parse `<q>` as `Quoted DoubleQuote`.
    + Handle nested `<q>` tags properly.
    + Modified `htmlTag` for fewer false positives.
      A tag must start with `<` followed by `!`,`?`, `/`, or a letter.
      This makes it more useful in the wikimedia and markdown parsers.

  * DocBook reader: Support title in "figure" element.  Closes #650.

  * MediaWiki writer:

    + Remove newline after `<br/>` in translation of `LineBreak`
      There's no particular need for a newline (other than making the
      generated MediaWiki source look nice to a human), and in fact
      sometimes it is incorrect: in particular, inside an enumeration, list
      items cannot have embedded newline characters. (Brent Yorgey)
    + Use `<code>` not `<tt>` for Code.

  * Man writer: Escape `-` as `\-`.
    Unescaped `-`'s become hyphens, while `\-`'s are left as ascii minus
    signs.  That is preferable for use with command-line options.  See
    <http://lintian.debian.org/tags/hyphen-used-as-minus-sign.html>.  Thanks
    to Andrea Bolognani for bringing the issue to our attention.

  * RST writer:

    + Improved line block output. Use nonbreaking spaces for
      initial indent (otherwise lost in HTML and LaTeX).
      Allow multiple paragraphs in a single line block.
      Allow soft breaks w continuations in line blocks.
    + Properly handle images with no alt text.  Closes #678.
    + Fixed bug with links with duplicate text.  We now (a) use anonymous
      links for links with inline URLs, and (b) use an inline link instead
      of a reference link if the reference link would require a label that
      has already been used for a different link.  Closes #511.
    + Fixed hyperlinked images. Closes #611. Use `:target:`
      field when you have a simple linked image.
    + Don't add `:align: center` to figures.

  * Texinfo writer:  Fixed internal cross-references.
    Now we insert anchors after each header, and use `@ref` instead of `@uref`
    for links.  Commas are now escaped as `@comma{}` only when needed;
    previously all commas were escaped.  (This change is needed, in part,
    because `@ref` commands must be followed by a real comma or period.) Also
    insert a blank line in from of `@verbatim` environments.

  * DocBook writer:

    + Made --id-prefix work in DocBook as well as HTML.
      Closes #607.
    + Don't include empty captions in figures.  Closes #581.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Use `\hspace*` for nonbreaking space after line break,
      since `~` spaces after a line break are just ignored.
      Closes #687.
    + Don't escape `_` in URLs or hyperref identifiers.
    + Properly escape strings inside \url{}.  Closes #576.
    + Use `[fragile]` only for slides containing code rendered
      using listings. Closes #649.
    + Escape `|` as `\vert` in LaTeX math.  This avoids a clash with
      highlighting-kate's macros, which redefine `|` as a short verbatim
      delimiter.  Thanks to Björn Peemöller for raising this issue.
    + Use minipage rather than parbox for block containers in tables.
      This allows verbatim code to be included in grid tables.
      Closes #663.
    + Prevent paragraphs containing only linebreaks or spaces.

  * HTML writer:

    + Included `highlighting-css` for code spans, too.
      Previously it was only included if used in a code block.  Closes #653.
    + Improved line breaks with `<dd>` tags.  We now put a newline between
      `</dd>` and `<dd>` when there are multiple definitions.
    + Changed mathjax cdn url so it doesn't use https.  (This caused
      problems when used with `--self-contained`.) See #609.

  * EPUB writer:

    + `--number-sections` now works properly.
    + Don't strip meta and link elements in epub metadata.
      Patch from aberrancy. Closes #589.
    + Fixed a couple validation bugs.
    + Use ch001, ch002, etc. for chapter filenames.  This improves sorting
      of chapters in some readers, which apparently sort ch2 after ch10.
      Closes #610.

  * ODT writer: properly set title property (Arlo O'Keeffe).

  * Docx writer:

    + Fixed bug with nested lists.  Previously a list like

            1. one
                - a
                - b
            2. two

      would come out with a bullet instead of "2."
      Thanks to Russell Allen for reporting the bug.
    + Use `w:cr` in `w:r` instead of `w:br` for linebreaks.
      This seems to fix a problem viewing pandoc-generated
      docx files in LibreOffice.
    + Use integer ids for bookmarks.  Closes #626.
    + Added nsid to abstractNum elements.  This helps when merging
      word documents with numbered or bulleted lists.  Closes #627.
    + Use separate footnotes.xml for notes.
      This seems to help LibreOffice convert the file, even though
      it was valid docx before.  Closes #637.
    + Use rIdNN identifiers for r:embed in images.
    + Avoid reading image files again when we've already processed them.
    + Fixed typo in `referenc.docx` that prevented image captions from
      working. Thanks to Huashan Chen.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + Fixed bug in `withRaw`, which didn't correctly handle the case
      where nothing is parsed.
    + Made `emailAddress` parser more correct.  Now it is based on RFC 822,
      though it still doesn't implement quoted strings in email addresses.
    + Revised URI parser.  It now allows many more schemes, allows
      uppercase URIs, and better handles trailing punctuation and
      trailing slashes in bare URIs.  Added many tests.
    + Simplified and improved singleQuoteStart.  This makes `'s'`, `'l'`,
      etc. parse properly.  Formerly we had some English-centric heuristics,
      but they are no longer needed. Closes #698.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Pretty`:  Added wide punctuation range to `charWidth`.
    This fixes bug with Chinese commas in markdown and reST tables, and
    a bug that caused combining characters to be dropped.

  * `Text.Pandoc.MIME`: Added MIME types for .wof and .eot.  Closes #640.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Biblio`:

    + Run `mvPunc` and `deNote` on metadata too.
      This fixed a bug with notes on titles using footnote styles.
    + Fixed bug in fetching CSL files from CSL data directory.

  * `pandoc.hs`:  Give correct value to `writerSourceDirectory` when a URL
    is provided.  It should be the URL up to the path.

  * Fixed/simplified diff output for tests.
    Biblio: Make sure mvPunc and deNote run on metadata too.
    This fixed a bug with notes on titles using footnote styles.

  [under the hood improvements]

  * We no longer depend on `utf8-string`.  Instead we use functions
    defined in `Text.Pandoc.UTF8` that use `Data.Text`'s conversions.

  * Use `safeRead` instead of using `reads` directly (various modules).

  * "Implicit figures" (images alone in a paragraph) are now handled
    differently.  The markdown reader gives their titles the prefix `fig:`; the
    writers look for this before treating the image as a figure.  Though this
    is a bit of a hack, it has two advantages: (i) implicit figures can be
    limited to the markdown reader, and (ii) they can be deactivated by turning
    off the `implicit_figures` extension.

  * `catch` from `Control.Exception` is now used instead of the
    old Preface `catch`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:  Improved algorithm for `normalizeSpaces`
    and `oneOfStrings` (which is now non-backtracking).

  * `Text.Pandoc.Biblio`: Remove workaround for `toCapital`.
    Now citeproc-hs is fixed upstream, so this is no longer needed.
    Closes #531.

  * Textile reader: Improved speed of `hyphenedWords`.
    This speeds up the textile  reader by about a factor of 4.

  * Use `Text.Pandoc.Builder` in RST reader, for more flexibility,
    better performance, and automatic normalization.

  * Major rewrite of markdown reader:

    + Use `Text.Pandoc.Builder` instead of lists.  This also
      means that everything is normalized automatically.
    + Move to a one-pass parsing strategy, returning values in the reader
      monad, which are then run (at the end of parsing) against the final
      parser state.

  * In HTML writer, we now use `toHtml` instead of pre-escaping.
    We work around the problem that blaze-html unnecessarily escapes `'`
    by pre-escaping just the `'` characters, instead of the whole string.
    If blaze-html later stops escaping `'` characters, we can simplify
    `strToHtml` to `toHtml`.  Closes #629.

  * Moved code for embedding images in RTFs from `pandoc.hs` to the
    RTF writer (which now exports `writeRTFWithEmbeddedImages`).

  * Moved citation processing from `pandoc.hs` into the readers.
    This makes things more convenient for library users.

  * The man pages are now built by an executable `make-pandoc-man-pages`,
    which has its own stanza in the cabal file so that dependencies can be
    handled by Cabal. Special treatment in `Setup.hs` ensures that this
    executable never gets installed; it is only used to create the man pages.

  * The cabal file has been modified so that the pandoc library is used
    in building the pandoc executable.  (This required moving `pandoc.hs`
    from `src` to `.`.)  This cuts compile time in half.

  * `-O2` is no longer used in building pandoc.  The performance improvement
    it yields is so slight that it is not worth it.  (Measured with
    benchmarks on ghc 7.4.)

  * The `executable` and `library` flags have been removed.

  * `-threaded` has been removed from ghc-options.

  * Version bounds of dependencies have been raised, and the
    `blaze_html_0_5` flag now defaults to True.  Pandoc now compiles on
    GHC 7.6.

  * We now require base >= 4.2.

  * Integrated the benchmark program into cabal.  One can now do:

        cabal configure --enable-benchmarks && cabal build
        cabal bench --benchmark-option='markdown' --benchmark-option='-s 20'

    The benchmark now uses README + testsuite, so benchmark results
    from older versions aren't comparable.

  * Integrated test suite with cabal.
    To run tests, configure with `--enable-tests`, then `cabal test`.
    You can specify particular tests using `--test-options='-t markdown'`.
    No output is shown unless tests fail.  The Haskell test modules
    have been moved from `src/` to `tests/`.

  * Moved all data files and templates to the `data/` subdirectory.

  * Added an `embed_data_files` cabal flag.  This causes all
    data files to be embedded in the binary, so that the binary
    is self-sufficient and can be relocated anywhere, copied on
    a USB key, etc.  The Windows installer now uses this.
    (Since we no longer have the option to build the executable
    without the library, this is the only way to get a relocatable
    binary on Windows.)

  * Removed pcre3.dll from windows package.
    It isn't needed unless highlighting-kate is compilled with the
    `pcre-light` flag. By default, regex-prce-builtin is used.


pandoc (1.9.4.2)

  * Don't encode/decode file paths if base >= 4.4.
    Prior to base 4.4, filepaths and command line arguments were treated
    as unencoded lists of bytes, not unicode strings, so we had to work
    around that by encoding and decoding them. This commit adds CPP
    checks for the base version that intelligibly enable encoding/decoding
    when needed. Fixes a bug with multilingual filenames when pandoc was
    compiled with ghc 7.4 (#540).

  * Don't generate an empty H1 after hrule slide breaks.
    We now use a slide-level header with contents `[Str "\0"]` to mark
    an hrule break.  This avoids creation of an empty H1 in these
    contexts.  Closes #484.

  * Docbook reader: Added support for "bold" emphasis.  Thanks to mb21.

  * In make_osx_package.sh, ensure citeproc-hs is built with the
    embed_data_files flag.

  * MediaWiki writer: Avoid extra blank lines after sublists (Gavin Beatty).

  * ConTeXt writer: Don't escape `&`, `^`, `<`, `>`, `_`,
    simplified escapes for `}` and `{` to `\{` and `\}` (Aditya Mahajan).

  * Fixed handling of absolute URLs in CSS imports with `--self-contained`.
    Closes #535.

  * Added webm to mime types. Closes #543.

  * Added some missing exports and tests to the cabal file
    (Alexander V Vershilov).

  * Compile with `-rtsopts` and `-threaded` by default.

pandoc (1.9.4.1)

  * Markdown reader: Added `cf.` and `cp.` to list of likely abbreviations.

  * LaTeX template: Added `linkcolor`, `urlcolor` and `links-as-notes`
    variables.  Make TOC links black.

  * LaTeX template improvements.

    + Don't print date unless one is given explicitly in the document.
    + Simplified templates.
    + Use fontenc [T1] by default, and lmodern.
    + Use microtype if available.

  * Biblio:

    + Add comma to beginning of bare suffix, e.g. `@item1 [50]`.
      Motivation: `@item1 [50]` should be as close as possible to
      `[@item1, 50]`.
    + Added workaround for a bug in citeproc-hs 0.3.4 that causes footnotes
      beginning with a citation to be empty.  Closes #531.

  * Fixed documentation on mixed lists.  Closes #533.

pandoc (1.9.4)

  * Simplified `Text.Pandoc.Biblio` and fixed bugs with citations inside
    footnotes and captions.  We now handle note citations by inserting
    footnotes during initial citation processing, and doing a separate
    pass later to remove notes inside notes.

  * Added 'zenburn' highlight style from highlighting-kate.

  * Added Slideous writer. Slideous is an HTML + javascript slide show
    format, similar to Slidy, but works with IE 7. (Jonas Smedegaard)

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Ensure we don't have extra blank lines at ends of cells.
      This can cause LaTeX errors, as they are interpreted as new paragraphs.
    + More consistent interblock spacing.
    + Require highlighting-kate >= 0.5.1, for proper highlighted inline
      code in LaTeX.  Closes #527.
    + Ensure that a Verbatim at the end of a footnote is followed by
      a newline. (Fixes a regression in the previous version.)
    + In default template, use black for internal links and TOC.
      Added commented-out code to use footnotes for links, as would
      be suitable in print output.

  * Beamer writer:  When `--incremental` is used, lists inside
    a block quote should appear all at once.  (This makes Beamer
    output consistent with the HTML slide show formats.)

  * ConTeXt writer:

    + Escape `%` as `\letterpercent{}` not `\letterpercent `,
      to avoid gobbling spaces after the `%` sign.
    + Ensure space after `\stopformula`.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Use `:` form instead of `~` in definition lists, for better
      compatibility with other markdown implementations.
    + Don't wrap the term, because it breaks definition lists.
    + Use a nonzero space to prevent false recognition
      of list marker in ordered lists.  Closes #516.

  * Org writer: Add space before language name.  Closes #523.

  * Docx writer: Simplified bullet characters so they work properly
    with Word 2007. Closes #520.

  * LaTeX reader: Support `\centerline`.

  * RST reader:  handle figures.  Closes #522.

  * Textile reader: fix for `<notextile>` and `==`.  Closes #517.
    (Paul Rivier)

pandoc (1.9.3)

  * Fixed bug in `fromEntities`.  The previous version would turn
    `hi & low you know;` into `hi &`.

  * HTML reader:

    + Don't skip nonbreaking spaces.
      Previously a paragraph containing just `&nbsp;` would be rendered
      as an empty paragraph. Thanks to Paul Vorbach for pointing out the bug.
    + Support `<col>` and `<caption>` in tables. Closes #486.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Don't recognize references inside delimited code blocks.
    + Allow list items to begin with lists.

  * Added basic docbook reader (John MacFarlane and Mauro Bieg).

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Handle `\bgroup`, `\egroup`, `\begingroup`, `\endgroup`.
    + Control sequences can't be followed by a letter.
      This fixes a bug where `\begingroup` was parsed as `\begin`
      followed by `group`.
    + Parse 'dimension' arguments to unknown commands.  e.g. `\parindent0pt`
    + Make `\label` and `\ref` sensitive to `--parse-raw`.
      If `--parse-raw` is selected, these will be parsed as raw latex
      inlines, rather than bracketed text.
    + Don't crash on unknown block commands (like `\vspace{10pt}`)
      inside `\author`; just skip them.  Closes #505.

  * Textile reader:

    + Implemented literal escapes with `==` and `<notextile>`.  Closes #473.
    + Added support for LaTeX blocks and inlines (Paul Rivier).
    + Better conformance to RedCloth inline parsing (Paul Rivier).
    + Parse '+text+' as emphasized (should be underlined, but this
      is better than leaving literal plus characters in the output.

  * Docx writer: Fixed multi-paragraph list items.  Previously they each
    got a list marker.  Closes #457.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Added `--no-tex-ligatures` option to avoid replacing
      quotation marks and dashes with TeX ligatures.
    + Use `fixltx2e` package to provide '\textsubscript'.
    + Improve spacing around LaTeX block environments:
      quote, verbatim, itemize, description, enumerate.
      Closes #502.
    + Use blue instead of pink for URL links in latex/pdf output.

  * ConTeXt writer: Fixed escaping of `%`.
    In text, `%` needs to be escaped as `\letterpercent`, not `\%`
    Inside URLs, `%` needs to be escaped as `\%`
    Thanks to jmarca and adityam for the fix.  Closes #492.

  * Texinfo writer:  Escape special characters in node titles.
    This fixes a problem pointed out by Joost Kremers.  Pandoc used
    to escape an '@' in a chapter title, but not in the corresponding
    node title, leading to invalid texinfo.

  * Fixed document encoding in texinfo template.
    Resolves Debian Bug #667816.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Don't force delimited code blocks to be flush left.
      Fixes bug with delimited code blocks inside lists etc.
    + Escape `<` and `$`.

  * LaTeX writer: Use `\hyperref[ident]{text}` for internal links.
    Previously we used `\href{\#ident}{text}`, which didn't work on
    all systems. Thanks to Dirk Laurie.

  * RST writer: Don't wrap link references.  Closes #487.

  * Updated to use latest versions of blaze-html, mtl.


pandoc (1.9.2)

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Made `lstlisting` work as a proper verbatim environment.
    + Fixed bug parsing LaTeX tables with one column.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Use `{}` around `ctable` caption, so that formatting can be used.
    + Don't require eurosym package unless document has a €.

  * LaTeX template: Added variables for `geometry`, `romanfont`,
    `sansfont`, `mathfont`, `mainfont` so users can more easily
    customize fonts.

  * PDF writer:

    + Run latex engine at least two times, to ensure
      that PDFs will have hyperlinked bookmarks.
    + Added PDF metadata (title,author) in LaTeX standalone + PDF output.

  * Texinfo writer: retain directories in image paths.  (Peter Wang)

  * RST writer:  Better handling of inline formatting, in accord
    with docutils' "inline markup recognition rules" (though we don't
    implement the unicode rules fully). Now `hi*there*hi` gets
    rendered properly as `hi\ *there*\ hi`, and unnecessary
    `\ ` are avoided around `:math:`, `:sub:`, `:sup:`.

  * RST reader:

    + Parse `\ ` as null, not escaped space.
    + Allow `` :math:`...` `` even when not followed by blank
      or `\`.  This does not implement the complex rule docutils follows,
      but it should be good enough for most purposes.
    + Add support for the rST default-role directive. (Greg Maslov)

  * Text.Pandoc.Parsing: Added `stateRstDefaultRole` field to `ParserState`.
    (Greg Maslov)

  * Markdown reader: Properly handle citations nested in other inline
    elements.

  * Markdown writer:  don't replace empty alt in image with "image".

  * DZSlides:  Updated template.html and styles in default template.
    Removed bizarre CSS for `q` in dzslides template.

  * Avoid repeated `id` attribute in section and header in HTML slides.

  * README improvements:  new instructions on internal links,
    removed misleading note on reST math.

  * Build system:

    + Fixed Windows installer so that dzslides works.
    + Removed stripansi.sh.
    + Added .travis.yml for Travis continuous integration support..
    + Fixed upper bound for zlib (Sergei Trofimovich).
    + Fixed upper bound for test-framework.
    + Updated haddocks for haddock-2.10 (Sergei Trofimovich).

pandoc (1.9.1.2)

  * Added `beamer+lhs` as output format.

  * Don't escape `<` in `<style>` tags with `--self-contained`.
    This fixes a bug which prevented highlighting from working
    when using `--self-contained`.

  * PDF: run latex engine three times if `--toc` specified.
    This fixes page numbers in the table of contents.

  * Docx writer: Added TableNormal style to tables.

  * LaTeX math environment fixes. `aligned` is now used instead of
    the nonexistent `aligned*`. `multline` instead of the nonexistent
    `multiline`.

  * LaTeX writer: Use `\textasciitilde` for literal `~`.

  * HTML writer: Don't escape contents of EQ tags with --gladtex.
    This fixes a regression from 1.8.

  * Use `<q>` tags for Quoted items for HTML5 output.
    The quote style can be changed by modifying the template
    or including a css file. A default quote style is included.

  * LaTeX reader: Fixed accents (\~{a}, `\c{c}`).
    Correctly handle \^{}. Support "minted" as a LaTeX verbatim block.

  * Updated LaTeX template for better language support.
    Use `polyglossia` instead of `babel` with xetex.
    Set `lang` as documentclass option.
    `\setmainlanguage` will use the last of a comma-separated
    list of languages. Thanks to François Gannaz.

  * Fixed default LaTeX template so `\euro` and `€` work.  The
    `eurosym` package is needed if you are using pdflatex.

  * Fixed escaping of period in man writer (thanks to Michael Thompson).

  * Fixed list label positions in beamer.

  * Set `mainlang` variable in context writer.
    This parallels behavior of latex writer.  `mainlang` is the last
    of a comma-separated list of languages in lang.

  * EPUB language metadat: convert e.g. `en_US` from locale to `en-US`.

  * Changed `-V` so that you can specify a key without a value.
    Such keys get the value `true`.

  * Fixed permissions on installed man pages - thanks Magnus Therning.

  * Windows installer: require XP or higher.  The installer is
    now compiled on a Windows 7 machine, which fixes a problem
    using citation functions on Windows 7.

  * OSX package: Check for 64-bit Intel CPU before installing.

pandoc (1.9.1.1)

  * Better handling of raw latex environments in markdown.  Now

        \begin{equation}
        a_1
        \end{equation}

    turns into a raw latex block as expected.

  * Improvements to LaTeX reader:

    + Skip options after block commands.
    + Correctly handle `{\\}` in braced.
    + Added a needed 'try'.
    + Citations: add `, ` to suffix if it doesn't start with space or
      punctuation. Otherwise we get no space between the year and the
      suffix in author-date styles.

  * Added two needed data files for S5.  This fixes a problem with
    `pandoc -t s5 --self-contained`.  Also removed `slides.min.js`,
    which was no longer being used.

  * Fixed some minor problems in `reference.docx`:
    name on "Date" style, `xCs` instead of `xIs`.

  * Fixed a problem creating docx files using a reference docx
    modified using Word.  The problem seems to be that Word
    modifies `_rels/.rels`, changing the Type of the Relationship to
    `docProps/core.xml`. Pandoc now changes this back to the correct
    value if it has been altered, fixing the problem.

  * Fixed html5 template so it works properly with highlighting.

pandoc (1.9.1)

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Fixed regression in 1.9; properly handle escaped $ in latex math.
    + Put LaTeX verse environments in blockquotes.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Limit nesting of strong/emph.  This avoids exponential lookahead
      in parasitic cases, like `a**a*a**a*a**a*a**a*a**a*a**a*a**a*a**`.
    + Improved attributes syntax (inn code blocks/spans):
      (1) Attributes can contain line breaks. (2) Values in key-value
      attributes can be surrounded by either double or single quotes, or
      left unquoted if they contain no spaces.

  * Don't wrap headers in markdown or RST writers.

  * Added `stateMaxNestingLevel` to `ParserState`.
    We set this to 6, so you can still have `Emph` inside `Emph`,
    just not indefinitely.

  * More efficient implementation of `nowrap` in `Text.Pandoc.Pretty`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.PDF`:  Only run latex twice if `\tableofcontents`
    is present.

  * Require highlighting-kate >= 0.5.0.2, texmath >= 0.6.0.2.

pandoc (1.9.0.5)

  * Changed cabal file so that build-depends for the test program
    are not required unless the tests flag is used.

  * LaTeX writer:  insert `{}` between adjacent hyphens so they don't
    form ligatures (dashes) in code spans.

pandoc (1.9.0.4)

  * Raised version bound on test-framework to avoid problems
    compiling tests on GHC 7.4.1.

  * LaTeX reader: Use raw LaTeX as fallback inline text for Cites,
    so citations don't just disappear unless you process with
    citeproc.  Ignore `\bibliographystyle`, `\nocite`.

  * Simplified tex2pdf; it will always run latex twice to
    resolve table of contents and hyperrefs.

pandoc (1.9.0.3)

  * Require Cabal >= 1.10.
  * Tweaked cabal file to meet Cabal 1.10 requirements.

pandoc (1.9.0.2)

  * Allow build with json 0.4 or 0.5.  Otherwise we can't build with
    ghc 6.12.

pandoc (1.9)

  [new features]

  * Added a Microsoft Word `docx` writer. The writer includes support
    for highlighted code and for math (which is converted from TeX to OMML,
    Office's native math markup language, using texmath's new OMML module).
    A new option `--reference-docx` allows the user to customize the
    styles.

  * Added an `asciidoc` writer (<http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/>).

  * Better support for slide shows:

    + Added a `dzslides` writer. DZSlides is a lightweight HTML5/javascript
      slide show format due to Paul Rouget (<http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/>).

    + Added a LaTeX `beamer` writer. Beamer is a LaTeX package for creating
      slide presentations.

    + New, flexible rules for dividing documents into sections and slides
      (see the "Structuring the slide show" in the User's Guide).  These
      are backward-compatible with the old rules, but they allow slide
      shows to be organized into sections and subsections containing
      multiple slides.

    + A new `--slide-level` option allows users to override defaults
      and select a slide level below the first header level with content.

  * A new `--self-contained` option produces HTML output that does not
    depend on an internet connection or the presence of any external
    files. Linked images, CSS, and javascript is downloaded (or fetched
    locally) and encoded in `data:` URIs. This is useful for making portable
    `HTML slide shows. The --offline` option has been deprecated and is now
    `treated as a synonym or --self-contained`.

  * Support for PDF output:

    + Removed the old `markdown2pdf`.
    + `pandoc` can now create PDFs (assuming you have latex and a set of
      appropriate packages installed): just specify an output file with the
      `.pdf` extension.
    + A new option `--latex-engine` allows you to specify `pdflatex`,
      `xelatex`, or `lualatex` as the processor.

  * Highlighting changes:

    + Syntax highlighting is now a standard feature; the `highlighting`
      flag is no longer needed when compiling.
    + A new `--no-highlight` option allows highlighting to be disabled.
    + Highlighting now works in `docx`, `latex`, and `epub`, as well as
      `html`, `html5`, `dzslides`, `s5`, and `slidy`.
    + A new `--highlight-style` option selects between various highlighting
      color themes.

  * Internal links to sections now work in ConTeXt and LaTeX as well as HTML.

  * LaTeX `\include` and `\usepackage` commands are now processed,
    provided the files are in the working directory.

  * EPUB improvements:

    + Internal and external links now work in EPUB.
    + Raw HTML is allowed.
    + New `--epub-embed-font` option.
    + Customizable templates for EPUB pages offer more control over
      formatting: `epub-page.html`, `epub-coverimage.html`,
      `epub-titlepage.html`.

  * `--mathml` now works with DocBook.

  * Added support for math in RST reader and writer.  Inline math uses the
    `` :math:`...` `` construct.  Display math uses

        .. math:: ...

    or if the math is multiline,

        .. math::

           ...

    These constructions are now supported now by `rst2latex.py`.

  * Github syntax for fenced code blocks is supported in pandoc's
    markdown.  You can now write

        ```ruby
        x = 2
        ```

    instead of

        ~~~ {.ruby}
        x = 2
        ~~~~

  * Easier scripting:  a new `toJsonFilter` function makes it easier to
    write Haskell scripts to manipulate the Pandoc AST.

  [behavior changes]

  * Fixed parsing of consecutive lists in markdown.
    Pandoc previously behaved like Markdown.pl for consecutive
    lists of different styles. Thus, the following would be parsed
    as a single ordered list, rather than an ordered list followed
    by an unordered list:

        1. one
        2. two

        - one
        - two

    This change makes pandoc behave more sensibly, parsing this as
    two lists.  Any change in list type (ordered/unordered) or in
    list number style will trigger a new list. Thus, the following
    will also be parsed as two lists:

        1. one
        2. two

        a. one
        b. two

    Since we regard this as a bug in Markdown.pl, and not something
    anyone would ever rely on, we do not preserve the old behavior
    even when `--strict` is selected.

  * Dashes work differently with `--smart`: `---` is always em-dash,
    and `--` is always en-dash.  Pandoc no longer tries to guess when
    `-` should be en-dash.  *Note:* This may change how existing documents
    look when processed with pandoc. A new option, `--old-dashes`,
    is provided for legacy documents.

  * The markdown writer now uses setext headers for levels 1-2.
    The old behavior (ATX headers for all levels) can be restored
    using the new `--atx-headers` option.

  * Links are now allowed in markdown image captions.  They are also
    allowed in links, but will appear there as regular text. So,

        [link with [link](/url)](/url)

    will turn into

        <p><a href="/url">link with link</a></p>

  * Improved handling of citations using `citeproc-hs-0.3.4`.
    Added `--citation-abbreviations` option.

  * Citation keys can no longer end with a punctuation character.
    This means that `@item1.` will be parsed as a citation with key
    'item1', followed by a period, instead of a citation with key
    'item1.', as was the case previously.

  * In HTML output, citations are now put in a span with class `citation`.

  * The markdown reader now recognizes DocBook block and inline tags.
    It was always possible to include raw DocBook tags in a markdown
    document, but now pandoc will be able to distinguish block from
    inline tags and behave accordingly. Thus, for example,

        <sidebar>
        hello
        </sidebar>

    will not be wrapped in `<para>` tags.

  * The LaTeX parser has been completely rewritten; it is now much more
    accurate, robust, and extensible. However, there are two important
    changes in how it treats unknown LaTeX. (1) Previously, unknown
    environments became BlockQuote elements; now, they are treated
    as "transparent", so `\begin{unknown}xyz\end{unknown}` is the
    same as `xyz`.  (2) Previously, arguments of unknown commands
    were passed through with their braces; now the braces are stripped
    off.

  * `--smart` is no longer selected automatically with `man` output.

  * The deprecated `--xetex` option has been removed.

  * The `--html5`/`-5` option has been deprecated. Use `-t html5`
    instead. `html5` and `html5+lhs` are now separate output formats.

  * Single quotes are no longer escaped in HTML output.  They do not
    need to be escaped outside of attributes.

  * Pandoc will no longer transform leading newlines in code
    blocks to `<br/>` tags.

  * The ODT writer now sizes images appropriately, using the image
    size and DPI information embedded in the image.

  * `--standalone` is once again implicitly for a non-text output format
    (ODT, EPUB).  You can again do `pandoc test.txt -o test.odt`
    and get a standalone ODT file.

  * The Docbook writer now uses `<sect1>`, `<sect2>`, etc. instead of
    `<section>`.

  * The HTML writer now uses `<del>` for strikeout.

  * In HTML output with `--section-divs`, the classes `section` and
    `level[1,2,..6]` are put on the `div` tags so they can be styled.
    In HTML 5 output with `--section-divs`, the classes
    `level[1,2,...6]` are put on `section` tags.

  * EPUB writer changes:

    + The `lang` variable now sets the language
      in the metadata (if it is not set, we default to the locale).
    + EPUB:  UTF-8 is used rather than decimal entities.

  * Added `titleslide` class to title slide in S5 template.

  * In HTML, EPUB, and docx metadata, the date is normalized into
    YYYY-MM-DD format if possible. (This is required for validation.)

  * Attributes in highlighted code blocks are now preserved in HTML.
    The container element will have the classes, id, and key-value attributes
    you specified in the delimited code block. Previously these were stripped
    off.

  * The reference backlink in the HTML writer no longer has a special
    `footnoteBacklink` class.

  * The HTML template has been split into `html` and `html5` templates.

  * Author and date are treated more consistently in HTML templates.
    Authors are now `<h2>`, date `<h3>`.

  * URLs are hyphenated in the ConTeXt writer (B. Scott Michel).

  * In `Text.Pandoc.Builder`, `+++` has been replaced by `<>`.

  [bug fixes]

  * Better support for combining characters and East Asian wide characters
    in markdown and reST.

  * Better handling of single quotes with `--smart`.
    Previously `D'oh l'*aide*` would be parsed with left and right single
    quotes instead of apostrophes. This kind of error is now fixed.

  * Highlighting: Use `reads` instead of `read` for better error handling.
    Fixes crash on `startNum="abc"`.

  * Added blank comment after directives in rst template.

  * Unescape entities in citation `refId`. The `refId`s coming
    from citeproc contain XML numeric entities, and these don't match with the
    citation keys parsed by pandoc. Solution is to unescape them.

  * HTML reader: Fixed bug parsing tables with both thead and tbody.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Better handling of escapes in link URLs and titles.
    + Fixed backslash escapes in reference links.
    + Fixed bug in table/hrule parsing, by checking that the top
      line of a table is not followed by a blank line. This bug caused
      slowdowns on some files with hrules and tables, as pandoc tried to
      interpret the hrules as the tops of multiline tables.
    + Fixed bug in code block attribute parser. Previously the ID attribute
      got lost if it didn't come first. Now attributes can come in any order.

  * RST reader: allow footnotes followed by newline without space characters.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Ignore empty groups {}, { }.
    + LaTeX reader: Handle \@.
    + LaTeX reader:  Don't crash on commands like `\itemsep`.
    + LaTeX reader:  Better handling of letter environments.

  * RST writer: Fixed bug involving empty table cells. isSimple was being
    calculated in a way that assumed there were no non-empty cells.

  * ConTeXt writer:

    + Made `--toc` work even without `--number-sections`.
    + Escape # in link URLs.
    + Use buffering for footnotes containing code blocks.
    + Changed 'descr' to 'description', fixed alignment.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Escape euro character.
    + Don't escape ~ inside href{...}.
    + Escape # in href URLs.
    + Improved detection of book classes.  We now check the
      `documentclass` variable, and if that is not set, we look through
      the template itself.  Also, we have added the KOMA classes scrreprt
      and scrbook.  You can now make a book using
      `pandoc -V documentclass:book mybook.txt -o mybook.pdf`
    + LHS files now set the "listings" variable, so that the definition
      of the `code` environment will be included in the template.
    + Links are colored blue by default (this can be changed by
      modifying `hyperref` settings in the template).
    + Added `lang` variable to LaTeX template.

  * HTML writer:

    + Fixed bug in HTML template with html5 and mathml.
    + Don't use self-closing img, br, hr tags for HTML5.
    + Use `<section>` for footnotes if HTML5.
    + Update HTML templates to use Content-Style-Type meta tag.
    + Use separate variables for meta-date, meta-author.
      This makes footnotes work in author and date fields.
    + Use 'vertical-align:middle' in WebTeX math for better alignment.

  * S5/slidy writer:  Make footnotes appear on separate slide at end.

  * MIME: Added 'layout-cache' to getMimeType. This ensures that the
    META-INF/manifest.xml for ODT files will have everything it needs, so
    that ODT files modified by LibreOffice can be used as `--reference-odt`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Templates`: Return empty string for json template.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Biblio`:

    + Expand citations recursively inside nested inlines.
    + Treat `\160` as space when parsing locator and suffix.
      This fixes a bug with "p. 33" when `--smart` is used. Previously
      the whole "p. 33" would be included in the suffix, with no locator.
    + Put whole author-in-text citation in a Cite.  Previously just the
      date and other info went in the Cite.
    + Don't add comma+space to prefix if it ends in punctuation.

  * Updated chicago-author-date.csl.  The old version did not work
    properly for edited volumes with no author.

  * EPUB writer:

    + Add date to EPUB titlepage and metadata.
    + Added TOC identifier in EPUB page template.
    + Don't generate superfluous file `cover-image.jpg`.

  [under the hood improvements]

  * Modified `make_osx_package.sh` to use cabal-dev.
    Items are no longer installed as root.
    Man pages are zipped and given proper permissions.

  * Modified windows installer generater to use cabal-dev.

  * Setup: Making man pages now works with cabal-dev (at least on OSX). In
    Setup.hs we now invoke 'runghc' in a way that points it to the correct
    package databases, instead of always falling back to the default user
    package db.

  * Updated to work with GHC 7.4.1.

  * Removed dependency on old-time.

  * Removed dependency on dlist.

  * New slidy directory for "self-contained."

  * TeXMath writer:  Use unicode thin spaces for thin spaces.

  * Markdown citations: don't strip off initial space in locator.

  [API changes]

  * Removed `Apostrophe`, `EmDash`, `EnDash`, and `Ellipses`
    from the native `Inline` type in pandoc-types.  Now we use `Str`
    elements with unicode.

  * Improvements to `Text.Pandoc.Builder`:

    + `Inlines` and `Blocks` are now newtypes (not synonyms for
      sequences).
    + Instances are defined for `IsString`, `Show`, `Read`, `Monoid`,
      and a new `Listable` class, which allows these to be manipulated
      to some extent like lists. Monoid append includes automatic
      normalization.
    + `+++` has been replaced by `<>` (mappend).

  * Use blaze-html instead of xhtml for HTML generation.
    This changes the type of `writeHtml`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:

    + Added `warn` and `err`.
    + Removed `unescapeURI`, modified `escapeURI`.
      (See under [behavior changes], above.)

  * Changes in URI escaping:  Previously the readers escaped URIs by
    converting unicode characters to octets and then percent encoding.
    Now unicode characters are left as they are, and `escapeURI` only
    percent-encodes space characters.  This gives more readable
    URIs, and works well with modern user agents. URIs are no longer unescaped
    at all on conversion to `markdown`, `asciidoc`, `rst`, `org`.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.SelfContained`.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.Docx`.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.PDF`.

  * Added `writerBeamer` to `WriterOptions`.

  * Added `normalizeDate` to `Text.Pandoc.Shared`.

  * Added `splitStringWithIndices` in `Text.Pandoc.Shared`.
    This is like `splitWithIndices`, but it is sensitive to distinctions
    between wide, combining, and regular characters.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Pretty`:

    + Added `chomp` combinator.
    + Added `beforeNonBreak` combinator.  This allows you to include
      something conditionally on it being before a nonblank.
      Used for RST inline math.
    + Added `charWidth` function. All characters marked W or F in the unicode
      spec EastAsianWidth.txt get width 2.
    + Added `realLength`, based on `charWidth`. `realLength` is now
      used in calculating offsets.

  * New module `Text.Pandoc.Slides`, for common functions for breaking
    a document into slides.

  * Removed `Text.Pandoc.S5`, which is no longer needed.

  * Removed `Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences`.  Moved
    `characterReference` to `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`.
    `decodeCharacterReferences` is replaced by `fromEntities`
    in `Text.Pandoc.XML`.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.ImageSize`.  This is intened for use
    in `docx` and `odt` writers, so the size and dpi of images
    can be calculated.

  * Removed `writerAscii` in `WriterOptions`.

  * Added `writerHighlight` to `WriterOptions`.

  * Added `DZSlides` to `HTMLSlideVariant`.

  * `writeEPUB` has a new argument for font files to embed.

  * Added `stateLastStrPos` to `ParserState`. This lets us keep track
    of whether we're parsing the position immediately after a regular
    (non-space, non-symbol) string, which is useful for distinguishing
    apostrophes from single quote starts.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + `escaped` now returns a `Char`.
    + Removed `charsInBalanced'`, added a character parser as
      a parameter of `charsInBalanced`.  This is needed for
      proper handling of escapes, etc.
    + Added `withRaw`.

  * Added `toEntities` to `Text.Pandoc.XML`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Readers.LaTeX`:

    + Export `handleIncludes`.
    + Export `rawLaTeXBlock` instead of `rawLaTeXEnvironment'`.

  * Added `ToJsonFilter` class and `toJsonFilter` function to
    `Text.Pandoc`, deprecating the old `jsonFilter` function.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Highlighting`:

     + Removed `highlightHtml`, `defaultHighlightingCss`.
     + Export `formatLaTeXInline`, `formatLaTeXBlock`, and `highlight`, plus
       key functions from highlighting-kate.
     + Changed types of highlighting function.  `highlight` returns a
       `Maybe`, not an `Either`.

pandoc (1.8.2.1)

  * Relaxed cabal consntraints for test-framework (S. Trofimovich).

  * Relaxed cabal constraints for pandoc-types.

  * Adjusted Arbitrary instance to help avoid timeouts in tests.

  * Added `Tests.Writers.Markdown` to cabal file.

pandoc (1.8.2)

  * Added script to produce OS X package.

  * Made `templates` directory a git submodule.  This should make it
    easier for people to revise their custom templates when the default
    templates change.

  * Changed template naming scheme: `FORMAT.template` -> `default.FORMAT`.
    **Note:** If you have existing templates in `~/.pandoc/templates`, you
    must rename them to conform to the new scheme!

  * Fixed smart quotes bug, now handling `'...hi'` properly.

  * RST reader:

    + Partial support for labeled footnotes.
    + Improved accuracy of `simpleReferenceName` parser.

  * HTML reader:

    + Substitute correct unicode characters for
      characters in the 128..159 range, which are often found even in
      HTML that purports to be UTF-8.

  * LaTeX reader:  Handle `\subtitle` command (a subtitle is added
    to the title, after a colon and linebreak). Closes #280.

  * Leaner `reference.odt`.

  * Added unexported module `Text.Pandoc.MIME` for use in
    the ODT writer.

  * ODT writer:  Construct `manifest.xml` based on archive contents.
    This fixes a bug in ODTs containing images. Recent versions of
    LibreOffice would reject these as corrupt, because `manifest.xml`
    did not contain a reference to the image files.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Make verbatim environments flush to avoid spurious
      blank lines.  Closes #277.
    + Use `\texttt` and escapes insntead of `\verb!...!`, which
      is too fragile (doesn't work in command arguments).
    + Use `\enquote{}` for quotes if the template includes
      the `csquotes` package. This provides better support for
      local quoting styles. (Thanks to Andreas Wagner for the idea.)

  * ConTeXt writer:  Make `\starttyping`/`\stoptyping` flush with
    margin, preventing spurious blank lines.

  * Slidy writer:

    + Use non-minimized version of `slidy.css` with `--offline`
      option, so users can more easily edit it.
    + Also fixed a bug in the CSS that prevented proper centering
      of title (now reported and fixed upstream).

  * S5 writer:

    + Replaced `s5/default/slides.js.{comment,packed}` with
      new compressed `s5/default/slides.min.js`.
    + Use `data:` protocol to embed S5 CSS in `<link>` tags,
      when `--offline` is specified. Using inline CSS didn't
      work with Chrome or Safari.  This fixes offline
      S5 on those browsers.

  * HTML writer:  Removed English title on footnote backlinks.
    This is incongrous in non-English documents.

  * Docbook writer:

    + Use CALS tables.  (Some older docbook software does not work
      well with XHTML tables.)  Closes #77.
    + Use `programlisting` tags (instead of `screen`) for code blocks.

  * `markdown2pdf`:

    + Calls latex with `-halt-on-error -interaction nonstopmode` instead
      of `-interaction=batchmode`, which essentially just ignored errors,
      leading to bad results. Better to know when something is wrong.
    + Fixed issues with non-UTF-8 output of `pdflatex`.
    + Better error reporting.

  * `--mathjax` now takes an optional URL argument. If it is not
    provided, pandoc links directly to the (secure) mathjax CDN,
    as now recommended (thanks to dsanson).

  * Deprecated `--xetex` option in `pandoc`.  It is no longer needed,
    since the LaTeX writer now produces a file that can be processed by
    `latex`, `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, or `xelatex`.

  * Introduced `--luatex` option to `markdown2pdf`. This causes `lualatex`
    to be used to create the PDF.

  * If a template specified with `--template` is not found, look for it
    in `datadir`.  Also, if no extension is provided, supply one based
    on the writer.  So now you can put your `special.latex` template in
    `~/.pandoc/templates`, and use it from any directory via
    `pandoc -t latex --template special`.

  * Default template improvements:

    + HTML:  Display author and date after title.
    + HTML:  Made table of contents more customizable.  The container
      for the TOC is now in the template, so users can insert a header
      or other styling. (Thanks to Bruce D'Arcus for the suggestion.)
    + HTML, Slidy, S5:  Enclose scripts in CDATA tags.
    + Slidy, S5: Added `s5-url` and `slidy-url` variables, instead of
      hard-coding.  If you want to put your slidy files in the slidy
      subdirectory, for example, you can do
      `pandoc -t slidy -V slidy-url=slidy -s`.
    + LaTeX: Use `\and` to separate authors in LaTeX documents (reader
      & writer).  Closes #279.
    + LaTeX: Use different `hyperref` options for `xetex`, fixing
      problems with unicode bookmarks (thanks to CircleCode).
    + LaTeX: Removed `ucs` package, use `utf8` rather than `utf8x`
      with `inputenc`.  This covers fewer characters but is more
      robust with other packages, and `ucs` is unmaintained.  Users
      who need better unicode support should use xelatex or lualatex.

pandoc (1.8.1.2)

  * Added `--epub-cover-image` option.

  * Documented `--biblatex` and `--natbib` options.

  * Allow `--section-divs` with slidy output.  Resolves Issue #296.

  * Disallow notes within notes in reST and markdown.
    These previously caused infinite looping and stack overflows.
    For example:

        [^1]

        [^1]: See [^1]

    Note references are allowed in reST notes, so this isn't a full
    implementation of reST. That can come later. For now we need to
    prevent the stack overflows.  Partially resolves Issue #297.

  * EPUB writer: Allow non-plain math methods.

  * Forbid ()s in citation item keys.  Resolves Issue #304: problems with
    `(@item1; @item2)` because the final paren was being parsed as part of
    the item key.

  * Changed URI parser so it doesn't include trailing punctuation.
    So, in RST, `http://google.com.` should be parsed as a link followed by a
    period. The parser is smart enough to recognize balanced parentheses, as
    often occur in wikipedia links: `http://foo.bar/baz_(bam)`.

  * Markdown+lhs reader: Require space after inverse bird tracks, so that
    HTML tags can be used freely at the left margin of a markdown+lhs document.
    Thanks to Conal Elliot for the suggestion.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Improved emph/strong parsing; fixes bug found by Perry Wagle.
    + Fixed bug in footnote order (reported by CircleCode).

  * RST reader:
      + Fixed bug in in field lists with multi-line items at the
        end of the list.
      + Added parentheses to RST `specialChars`, so
        `(http://google.com)` will be parsed as a link in parens.
        Resolves Issue #291.
      + Allow `|` followed by newline in RST line block.

  * LaTeX reader:
      + Support `\dots`.
      + Gobble option & space after linebreak `\\[10pt]`.

  * Textile reader:
      + Make it possible to have colons after links.  (qerub)
      + Make it possible to have colons after links.  (Christoffer Sawicki)

  * HTML reader:
      + Skip spaces after `<b>`, `<emph>`, etc.
      + Handle tbody, thead in simple tables.  Closes #274.
      + Implicit `Para`s instead of `Plains` in some contexts.

  * OpenDocument writer:  Use special `First paragraph` style for
    first paragraph after most non-paragraph blocks. This allows users to
    specify e.g. that only paragraphs after the first paragraph of a block are
    to be indented. Thanks to Andrea Rossato for the patch. Closes #20.

  * LaTeX writer:  use `deVerb` on table and picture captions.
    Otherwise LaTeX complains about `\verb` inside command argument.
    Thanks to bbanier for reporting the bug.

  * Markdown writer: Insert HTML comment btw list and indented code block.
    This prevents the code block from being interpreted as part of the list.

  * EPUB writer: Add a meta element specify the cover.
    Some EPUB e-readers, such as the Nook, require a meta element inside the
    OPF metadata block to ensure the cover image is properly displayed.
    (Kelsey Hightower)

  * HTML writer: Use embed tag for images with non-image extensions.
    (e.g.  PDFs).  Closes #264.

  * LaTeX writer: Improved tables.

      + More space between lines, top-align cells.
      + Use ctable package, which allows footnotes and
        provides additional options.
      + Made cell alignments work in multiline tables.
      + Closes #271, #272.

  * Un-URI-escape image filenames in LaTeX, ConTeXt, RTF, Texinfo.
    Also do this when copying image files into EPUBs and ODTs.
    Closes #263.

  * Changed to github issue tracker.

  * Added failing emph/strong markdown test case due to Perry Wagle.

  * Slidy improvements:
      + Updated to use Slidy2.
      + Fixed bug, unclosed div tag.
      + Added `duration` variable in template.
        Setting this activates the timer.
      + Use 'titlepage' instead of 'cover' for title div.

pandoc (1.8.1.1)

  * `markdown2pdf`:  Removed some debugging lines accidentally included
    in the 1.8.1 release. With those lines, the temp directory is created
    in the working directory, and it is not deleted.  This fix restores
    the original behavior.

pandoc (1.8.1)

  * Added `--ascii` option.  Currently supported only in HTML writer,
    which it causes to use numerical entities instead of UTF-8.

  * EPUB writer: `--toc` now works to provide a table of contents
    at the beginning of each chapter.

  * LaTeX writer:  Change figure defaults to `htbp`.
    This prevents "too many unprocessed floats."  Resolves
    Issue #285.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8`:  Encode filenames even when using recent
    base.

  * `markdown2pdf`: Fixed filename encoding issues. With help from Paulo
    Tanimoto. Resolves Issue #286.

  * HTML writer: Put line breaks in section divs.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`: Make `writerSectionDivs` default to False.

pandoc (1.8.0.3)

  * Fixed Source-repository stanza in cabal file.

pandoc (1.8.0.2)

  * HTML writer:

    + Stringify alt text instead of converting to HTML.
    + Break lines after block elements, not inside tags.
      HTML output now closely resembles that of tidy. Resolves Issue #134.

  * Markdown reader: Fixed bug in footnote block parser (pointed out
    by Jesse Rosenthal).  The problem arose when the blank line
    at the end of a footnote block contained indenting spaces.

  * Shared: Improved 'normalize' function so it normalizes Spaces too.
    In normal form, Space elements only occur to separate two non-Space
    elements.  So, we never have [Space], or [, ..., Space].

  * Tests:

    + Improved Arbitrary instance.
    + Added timeout for test instances.

  * README:

    + Added section on four-space rule for lists.  Resolves Issue #283.
    + Clarified optional arguments on math options.

  * markdown2pdf: Fixed bug with output file extensions.
    Previously `markdown2pdf test.txt -o test.en.pdf` would produce
    `test.pdf`, not `test.en.pdf`.  Thanks to Paolo Tanimoto for the fix.

pandoc (1.8.0.1)

  * Revised Interact.hs so that it works with the CPP macros
    in the UTF8 module.

  * Revised Setup.hs so that we don't call MakeManPage.hs unless
    the man pages are out of date.

pandoc (1.8)

  [new features]

  * Support for citations using Andrea Rossato's `citeproc-hs` 0.3.
    You can now write, for example,

        Water is wet [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

    and, when you process your document using `pandoc`, specifying
    a citation style using `--csl` and a bibliography using `--bibliography`,
    the citation will be replaced by an appropriately formatted
    citation, and a list of works cited will be added to the end
    of the document.

    This means that you can switch effortlessly between different citation
    and bibliography styles, including footnote, numerical, and author-date
    formats. The bibliography can be in any of the following formats: MODS,
    BibTeX, BibLaTeX, RIS, EndNote, EndNote XML, ISI, MEDLINE, Copac, or JSON.
    See the README for further details.

    Citations are supported in the markdown reader, using a special
    syntax, and in the LaTeX reader, using natbib or biblatex syntax.
    (Thanks to Nathan Gass for the natbib and biblatex support.)

  * New `textile` reader and writer.  Thanks to Paul Rivier for contributing
    the `textile` reader, an almost complete implementation of the textile
    syntax used by the ruby [RedCloth library](http://redcloth.org/textile).
    Resolves Issue #51.

  * New `org` writer, for Emacs Org-mode, contributed by Puneeth Chaganti.

  * New `json` reader and writer, for reading and writing a JSON
    representation of the native Pandoc AST.  These are much faster
    than the `native` reader and writer, and should be used for
    serializing Pandoc to text.  To convert between the JSON representation
    and native Pandoc, use `encodeJSON` and `decodeJSON` from
    `Text.JSON.Generic`.

  * A new `jsonFilter` function in `Text.Pandoc` makes it easy
    to write scripts that transform a JSON-encoded pandoc document.
    For example:

        -- removelinks.hs - removes links from document
        import Text.Pandoc
        main = interact $ jsonFilter $ bottomUp removeLink
                 where removeLink (Link xs _) = Emph xs
                       removeLink x = x

    To use this to remove links while translating markdown to LaTeX:

        pandoc -t json | runghc removelinks.hs | pandoc -f json -t latex

  * Attributes are now allowed in inline `Code` elements, for example:

        In this code, `ulist ! [theclass "special"] << elts`{.haskell} is...

    The attribute syntax is the same as for delimited code blocks.
    `Code` inline has an extra argument place for attributes, just like
    `CodeBlock`. Inline code will be highlighted in HTML output, if pandoc
    is compiled with highlighting support. Resolves Issue #119.

  * New `RawBlock` and `RawInline` elements (replacing `RawHtml`,
    `HtmlInline`, and `TeX`) provide lots of flexibility in writing
    scripts to transform Pandoc documents. Scripts can now change
    how each element is rendered in each output format.

  * You can now define LaTeX macros in markdown documents, and pandoc
    will apply them to TeX math.  For example,

        \newcommand{\plus}[2]{#1 + #2}
        $\plus{3}{4}$

    yields `3+4`.  Since the macros are applied in the reader, they
    will work in every output format, not just LaTeX.

  * LaTeX macros can also be used in LaTeX documents (both in math
    and in non-math contexts).

  * A new `--mathjax` option has been added for displaying
    math in HTML using MathJax.  Resolves issue #259.

  * Footnotes are now supported in the RST reader. (Note, however,
    that unlike docutils, pandoc ignores the numeral or symbol used in
    the note; footnotes are put in an auto-numbered ordered list.)
    Resolves Issue #258.

  * A new `--normalize` option causes pandoc to normalize the AST
    before writing the document.  This means that, for example,
    `*hi**there*` will be rendered as `<em>hithere</em>`
    instead of `<em>hi</em><em>there</em>`.  This is not the default,
    because there is a significant performance penalty.

  * A new `--chapters` command-line option causes headers
    in DocBook, LaTeX, and ConTeXt to start with "chapter" (level one).
    Resolves Issue #265.

  * In DocBook output, `<chapter>` is now used for top-level
    headers if the template contains `<book>`. Resolves Issue #265.

  * A new `--listings` option in `pandoc` and `markdown2pdf` causes
    the LaTeX writer to use the listings package for code blocks.
    (Thanks to Josef Svennigsson for the pandoc patch, and Etienne
    Millon for the markdown2pdf patch.)

  * `markdown2pdf` now supports `--data-dir`.

  * URLs in autolinks now have class "url" so they can be styled.

  * Improved prettyprinting in most formats.  Lines will be wrapped
    more evenly and duplicate blank lines avoided.

  * New `--columns` command-line option sets the column width for
    line wrapping and relative width calculations for tables.

  * Made `--smart` work in HTML, RST, and Textile readers, as well
    as markdown.

  * Added `--html5` option for HTML5 output.

  * Added support for listings package in LaTeX reader
    (Puneeth Chaganti).

  * Added support for simple tables in the LaTeX reader.

  * Added support for simple tables in the HTML reader.

  * Significant performance improvements in many readers and writers.

  [API and program changes]

  * Moved `Text.Pandoc.Definition` from the `pandoc` package to a new
    auxiliary package, `pandoc-types`. This will make it possible for other
    programs to supply output in Pandoc format, without depending on the whole
    pandoc package.

  * Added `Attr` field to `Code`.

  * Removed `RawHtml`, `HtmlInline`, and `TeX` elements; added generic
    `RawBlock` and `RawInline`.

  * Moved generic functions to `Text.Pandoc.Generic`. Deprecated
    `processWith`, replacing it with two functions, `bottomUp` and `topDown`.
    Removed previously deprecated functions `processPandoc` and `queryPandoc`.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Builder`, for building `Pandoc` structures.

  * `Text.Pandoc` now exports association lists `readers` and `writers`.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Native`, which exports `readNative`.
    `readNative` can now read full pandoc documents, block lists, blocks,
    inline lists, or inlines.  It will interpret `Str "hi"`
    as if it were `Pandoc (Meta [] [] []) [Plain [Str "hi"]]`.
    This should make testing easier.

  * Removed deprecated `-C/--custom-header` option.
    Use `--template` instead.

  * `--biblio-file` has been replaced by `--bibliography`.
    `--biblio-format` has been removed; pandoc now guesses the format
    from the file extension (see README).

  * pandoc will treat an argument as a URI only if it has an
    `http(s)` scheme.  Previously pandoc would treat some
    Windows pathnames beginning with `C:/` as URIs.

  * The `--sanitize-html` option and the `stateSanitize` field in
    `ParserState` have been removed. Sanitization is better done in the
    resulting HTML using `xss-sanitize`, which is based on pandoc's
    sanitization, but improved.

  * pandoc now adds a newline to the end of its output in fragment
    mode (= not `--standalone`).

  * Added support for `lang` in `html` tag in the HTML template,
    so you can do `pandoc -s -V lang=es`, for example.

  * `highlightHtml` in `Text.Pandoc.Highlighting` now takes
    a boolean argument that selects between "inline" and
    "block" HTML.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Writers.RTF` now exports `rtfEmbedImage`.
    Images are embedded in RTF output when possible (png, jpeg).
    Resolves Issue #275.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Pretty`. This is better suited for pandoc than the
    `pretty` package.  Changed all writers that used
    `Text.PrettyPrint.HughesPJ` to use `Text.Pandoc.Pretty` instead.

  * Rewrote `writeNative` using the new prettyprinting module. It is
    now much faster. The output has been made more consistent and compressed.
    `writeNative` is also now sensitive to writerStandalone`, and will simply
    `print a block list if writerStandalone` is False.

  * Removed `Text.Pandoc.Blocks`. `Text.Pandoc.Pretty` allows you to define
    blocks and concatenate them, so a separate module is no longer needed.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:

    + Added `writerColumns`, `writerChapters`, and `writerHtml5` to
      `WriterOptions`.
    + Added `normalize`.
    + Removed unneeded prettyprinting functions:
      `wrapped`, `wrapIfNeeded`, `wrappedTeX`, `wrapTeXIfNeeded`, `hang'`,
      `BlockWrapper`, `wrappedBlocksToDoc`.
    + Made `splitBy` take a test instead of an element.
    + Added `findDataFile`, refactored `readDataFile`.
    + Added `stringify`. Rewrote `inlineListToIdentifier` using `stringify`.
    + Fixed `inlineListToIdentifier` to treat '\160' as ' '.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML`:

    + Removed `rawHtmlBlock`, `anyHtmlBlockTag`, `anyHtmlInlineTag`,
      `anyHtmlTag`, `anyHtmlEndTag`, `htmlEndTag`, `extractTagType`,
      `htmlBlockElement`, `htmlComment`
    + Added `htmlTag`, `htmlInBalanced`, `isInlineTag`, `isBlockTag`,
      `isTextTag`

  * Moved `smartPunctuation` from `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown`
    to `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Parsing`, and parameterized it with
    an inline parser.

  * Added `nonspaceChar` to `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`.

  * Ellipses are no longer allowed to contain spaces.
    Previously we allowed '. . .', ' . . . ', etc.  This caused
    too many complications, and removed author's flexibility in
    combining ellipses with spaces and periods.

  * Allow linebreaks in URLs (treat as spaces). Also, a string of
    consecutive spaces or tabs is now parsed as a single space. If you have
    multiple spaces in your URL, use `%20%20`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + Removed `refsMatch`.
    + Hid `Key` constructor.
    + Removed custom `Ord` and `Eq` instances for `Key`.
    + Added `toKey` and `fromKey` to convert between `Key` and `[Inline]`.
    + Generalized type on `readWith`.

  * Small change in calculation of relative widths of table columns.
    If the size of the header > the specified column width, use
    the header size as 100% for purposes of calculating
    relative widths of columns.

  * Markdown writer now uses some pandoc-specific features when `--strict`
    is not specified: `\` newline is used for a hard linebreak instead of
    two spaces then a newline. And delimited code blocks are used when
    there are attributes.

  * HTML writer:  improved gladTeX output by setting ENV appropriately
    for display or inline math (Jonathan Daugherty).

  * LaTeX writer: Use `\paragraph`, `\subparagraph` for level 4,5 headers.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + `\label{foo}` and `\ref{foo}` now become `{foo}` instead of `(foo)`.
    + `\index{}` commands are skipped.

  * Added `fontsize` variable to default LaTeX template.
    This makes it easy to set the font size using `markdown2pdf`:
    `markdown2pdf -V fontsize=12pt input.txt`.

  * Fixed problem with strikeout in LaTeX headers when using
    hyperref, by adding a command to the default LaTeX template
    that disables `\sout` inside pdf strings. Thanks to Joost Kremers
    for the fix.

  * The `COLUMNS` environment variable no longer has any effect.

  [under-the-hood improvements]

  * Pandoc now compiles with GHC 7. (This alone leads to a
    significant performance improvement, 15-20%.)

  * Completely rewrote HTML reader using tagsoup as a lexer. The
    new reader is faster and more accurate.  Unlike the
    old reader, it does not get bogged down on some input
    (Issues #277, 255). And it handles namespaces in tags
    (Issue #274).

  * Replaced `escapeStringAsXML` with a faster version.

  * Rewrote `spaceChar` and some other parsers in Text.Pandoc.Parsing
    for a significant performance boost.

  * Improved performance of all readers by rewriting parsers.

  * Simplified Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences by using
    entity lookup functions from TagSoup.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8` now uses the unicode-aware IO functions
    from `System.IO` if base >= 4.2.  This gives support for
    windows line endings on windows.

  * Remove duplications in documentation by generating the
    pandoc man page from README, using `MakeManPage.hs`.

  * README now includes a full description of markdown syntax,
    including non-pandoc-specific parts.  A new `pandoc_markdown`
    man page is extracted from this, so you can look up markdown
    syntax by doing `man pandoc_markdown`.

  * Completely revised test framework (with help from Nathan Gass).
    The new test framework is built when the `tests` Cabal flag is set. It
    includes the old integration tests, but also some new unit and quickcheck
    tests. Test output has been much improved, and you can now specify a glob
    pattern after `cabal test` to indicate which tests should be run;
    for example `cabal test citations` will run all the citation tests.

  * Added a shell script, `stripansi.sh`, for filtering ANSI control
    sequences from test output: `cabal test | ./stripansi.sh > test.log`.

  * Added `Interact.hs` to make it easier to use ghci while developing.
    `Interact.hs` loads `ghci` from the `src` directory, specifying
    all the options needed to load pandoc modules (including
    specific package dependencies, which it gets by parsing
    dist/setup-config).

  * Added `Benchmark.hs`, testing all readers + writers using criterion.

  * Added `stats.sh`, to make it easier to collect and archive
    benchmark and lines-of-code stats.

  * Added upper bounds to all cabal dependencies.

  * Include man pages in extra-source-files.  This allows users to
    install pandoc from the tarball without needing to build the man
    pages.

  [bug fixes]

  * Filenames are encoded as UTF8.  Resolves Issue #252.

  * Handle curly quotes better in `--smart` mode. Previously, curly quotes
    were just parsed literally, leading to problems in some output formats.
    Now they are parsed as `Quoted` inlines, if `--smart` is specified.
    Resolves Issue #270.

  * Text.Pandoc.Parsing: Fixed bug in grid table parser.
    Spaces at end of line were not being stripped properly,
    resulting in unintended LineBreaks.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Allow HTML comments as inline elements in markdown.
      So, `aaa <!-- comment --> bbb` can be a single paragraph.
    + Fixed superscripts with links: `^[link](/foo)^` gets
      recognized as a superscripted link, not an inline note followed by
      garbage.
    + Fixed regression, making markdown reference keys case-insensitive again.
      Resolves Issue #272.
    + Properly handle abbreviations (like `Mr.`) at the end of a line.
    + Better handling of intraword underscores, avoiding exponential
      slowdowns in some cases.  Resolves Issue #182.
    + Fixed bug in alignments in tables with blank rows in the header.

  * RST reader:

    + Field lists now allow spaces in field names, and
      block content in field values. (Thanks to Lachlan Musicman
      for pointing out the bug.)
    + Definition list items are now always `Para` instead of
      `Plain`, matching behavior of `rst2xml.py`.
    + In image blocks, the description is parsed properly and
      used for the alt attribute, not also the title.
    + Skip blank lines at beginning of file. Resolves
      Debian #611328.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Improved parsing of preamble.
      Previously you'd get unexpected behavior on a document that
      contained `\begin{document}` in, say, a verbatim block.
    + Allow spaces between `\begin` or `\end` and `{`.
    + Support `\L` and `\l`.
    + Skip comments inside paragraphs.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Escape strings in `\href{..}`.
    + In nonsimple tables, put cells in `\parbox`.

  * OpenDocument writer:  don't print raw TeX.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Fixed bug in `Image`.  URI was getting unescaped twice!
    + Avoid printing extra blank lines at the end if there are
      no notes or references.

  * LaTeX and ConTeXt: Escape `[` and `]` as `{[}` and `{]}`.
    This avoids unwanted interpretation as an optional argument.

  * ConTeXt writer: Fixed problem with inline code.  Previously
    `}` would be rendered `\type{}}`. Now we check the string for '}' and '{'.
    If it contains neither, use `\type{}`; otherwise use `\mono{}`
    with an escaped version of the string.

  * `:` now allowed in HTML tags. Resolves Issue #274.

pandoc (1.6)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * New EPUB and HTML Slidy writers. (Issue #122)

      - EPUB is a standard ebook format, used in Apple's iBooks for
        the iPad and iPhone, Barnes and Noble's nook reader, the Sony
        reader, and many other devices.
      - Slidy, like S5, is a system for producing HTML+javascript slide
        shows.

  * All input is assumed to be UTF-8, no matter what the locale and ghc
    version, and all output is UTF-8. This reverts to pre-1.5 behavior.
    Also, a BOM, if present, is stripped from the input.

  * Markdown now supports grid tables, whose cells can contain
    arbitrary block elements. (Issue #43)

  * Sequentially numbered example lists in markdown with `@` marker.

  * Markdown table captions can begin with a bare colon and no longer need
    to include the English word "table." Also, a caption can now occur
    either before or after the table. (Issue #227)

  * New command-line options:

      - `--epub-stylesheet` allows you to specify a CSS file that will
        be used to style your ebook.
      - `--epub-metadata` allows you to specify metadata for the ebook.
      - `--offline` causes the generated HTML slideshow to include all
        needed scripts and stylesheets.
      - `--webtex` causes TeX math to be converted to images using the
        Google Charts API (unless a different URL is specified).
      - `--section-divs` causes div tags to be added around each section
        in an HTML document. (Issue #230, 239)

  * Default behavior of S5 writer in standalone mode has changed:
    previously, it would include all needed scripts and stylesheets
    in the generated HTML; now, only links are included unless
    the `--offline` option is used.

  * Default behavior of HTML writer has changed. Between 1.2 and 1.5,
    pandoc would enclose sections in div tags with identifiers on the
    div tags, so that the sections can be manipulated in javascript.
    This caused undesirable interactions with raw HTML div tags. So,
    starting with 1.6, the default is to put the identifiers directly
    on the header tags, and not to include the divs.  The `--section-divs`
    option selects the 1.2-1.5 behavior.

  * API changes:

      - `HTMLMathMethod`: Added `WebTeX`, removed `MimeTeX`.
      - `WriterOptions`: Added `writerUserDataDir`, `writerSourceDirectory`,
        `writerEPUBMetadata` fields. Removed `writerIncludeBefore`,
        `writerIncludeAfter`.
      - Added `headerShift` to `Text.Pandoc.Shared`.
      - Moved parsing code and `ParserState` from `Text.Pandoc.Shared`
        to a new module, `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`.
      - Added `stateHasChapters` to `ParserState`.
      - Added `HTMLSlideVariant`.
      - Made `KeyTable` a map instead of an association list.
      - Added accessors for `Meta` fields (`docTitle`, `docAuthors`,
        `docDate`).
      - `Pandoc`, `Meta`, `Inline`, and `Block` have been given `Ord`
        instances.
      - Reference keys now have a type of their own (`Key`), with its
        own `Ord` instance for case-insensitive comparison.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.EPUB`.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.UUID`.
      - Removed `Text.Pandoc.ODT`, added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.ODT`.
        Removed `saveOpenDocumentAsODT`, added `writeODT`.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.Native` and `writeNative`.
        Removed `prettyPandoc`.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.UTF8` for portable UTF8 string IO.
      - Removed `Text.Pandoc.Writers.S5` and the `writeS5` function.
        Moved `s5Includes` to a new module, `Text.Pandoc.S5`.
        To write S5, you now use `writeHtml` with `writerSlideVariant`
        set to `S5Slides` or `SlidySlides`.

  * Template changes.  If you use custom templates, please update them,
    particularly if you use syntax highlighting with pandoc. The old HTML
    templates hardcoded highlighting CSS that will no longer work with
    the most recent version of highlighting-kate.

      - HTML template: avoid empty meta tag if no date.
      - HTML template: Use default highlighting CSS from highlighting-kate
        instead of hard-coding the CSS into the template.
      - HTML template: insert-before text goes before the title, and
        immediately after the <body> tag, as documented. (Issue #241)
      - Added slidy and s5 templates.
      - Added amssymb to preamble of latex template. (github Issue 1)

  * Removed excess newlines at the end of output. Note: because output
    will not contain an extra newline, you may need to make adjustments
    if you are inserting pandoc's output into a template.

  * In S5 and slidy, horizontal rules now cause a new slide, so you
    are no longer limited to one slide per section.

  * Improved handling of code in man writer. Inline code is now monospace,
    not bold, and code blocks now use .nf (no fill) and .IP (indented para).

  * HTML reader parses `<tt>` as Code. (Issue #247)

  * html+lhs output now contains bird tracks, even when compiled without
    highlighting support. (Issue #242)

  * Colons are now no longer allowed in autogenerated XML/HTML identifiers,
    since they have a special meaning in XML.

  * Code improvements in ODT writer.  Remote images are now replaced with
    their alt text rather than a broken link.

  * LaTeX reader improvements:

      - Made latex `\section`, `\chapter` parsers more forgiving of
        whitespace.
      - Parse `\chapter{}` in latex.
      - Changed `rawLaTeXInline` to accept `\section`, `\begin`, etc.
      - Use new `rawLaTeXInline'` in LaTeX reader, and export `rawLaTeXInline`
        for use in markdown reader.
      - Fixes bug wherein `\section{foo}` was not recognized as raw TeX
        in markdown document.

  * LaTeX writer:  images are automatically shrunk if they would extend
    beyond the page margin.

  * Plain, markdown, RST writers now use unicode for smart punctuation.

  * Man writer converts math to unicode when possible, as in other writers.

  * `markdown2pdf` can now recognize citeproc options.

  * Command-line arguments are converted to UTF-8. (Issue #234)

  * `Text.Pandoc.TeXMath` has been rewritten to use texmath's parser.
    This allows it to handle a wider range of formulas. Also, if a formula
    cannot be converted, it is left in raw TeX; formulas are no longer
    partially converted.

  * Unicode curly quotes are left alone when parsing smart quotes. (Issue
    #143)

  * Cabal file changes:

      - Removed parsec < 3 restriction.
      - Added 'threaded' flag for architectures where GHC lacks a threaded
        runtime.
      - Use 'threaded' only for markdown2pdf; it is not needed for pandoc.
      - Require highlighting-kate 0.2.7.

  * Use explicit imports from `Data.Generics`. Otherwise we have a
    conflict with the 'empty' symbol, introduced in syb >= 0.2. (Issue #237)

  * New data files:  slidy/slidy.min.js, slidy/slidy.min.css, epub.css.

pandoc (1.5.1.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed uniqueIdent in Shared so that header identifiers work as
   advertized in the README and are are valid XHTML names.

pandoc (1.5.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed treatment of unicode characters in URIs.
    + Shared now exports escapeURI and unescapeURI. These handle
      UTF8 encoding and decoding as well as URI escaping/unescaping.
    + Shared: uri and emailAddress now return a pair of the original
      parsed text and the escaped URI (in the latter case, with
      the mailto: prefix).
    + HTML reader: unsanitaryURI has been modified to allow unicode
      high characters in a URI.
    + Readers:  All link and image URIs are now escaped using
      escapeURI.
    + Markdown and RST writers:  unescapeURI is used so that URIs
      in these formats are human-readable.

  * Setup.hs: Don't assume that the build directory is "dist".
    Instead, get it from localBuildInfo.

  * OpenDocument writer: Use a Map for stTextStyleAttr.
    This avoids duplicates (and invalid xml). Resolves Issue #222.

pandoc (1.5.0.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * HTML writer: Fixed error in math writer (with MathML option)
    that caused an infinite loop for unparsable MathML.

pandoc (1.5)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added --mathml option.  When this is selected, pandoc will convert
    TeX math into MathML.
    + Added data/MathMLinHTML.js, which is included when no URL is
      provided for --mathml.  This allows MathML to be displayed (in
      better browsers) as text/html.
    + Removed Text.Pandoc.LaTeXMathML.  The module was no longer
      necessary; it was replaced by two lines in pandoc.hs.
    + Replaced LaTeXMathML.js.commend and LaTeXMathML.js.packed with a
      single combined file, LaTeXMathML.js.

  * Added --data-dir option.
    This specifies a user data directory. If not specified, will default
    to ~/.pandoc on unix or Application Data\pandoc on Windows.
    Files placed in the user data directory will override system default
    data files.

  * Added Maybe datadir parameter to readDataFile, saveOpenDocumentAsODT,
    latexMathMLScript, s5HeaderIncludes, and getDefaultTemplate. If
	  Nothing, no user directory is searched for an override.

  * Added 'plain' output format. This is similar to markdown, but
    removes links, pictures, inline formatting, and most anything that
    looks even vaguely markupish. The function writePlain is exported by
    Text.Pandoc.Writers.Markdown, with which it shares most of its code.

  * Allow multi-line titles and authors in meta block.
    Titles may span multiple lines, provided continuation lines
    begin with a space character.  Separate authors may be put on
    multiple lines, provided each line after the first begins with
    a space character.  Each author must fit on one line. Multiple
    authors on a single line may still be separated by a semicolon.
    Based on a patch by Justin Bogner.

  * When given an absolute URI as parameter, pandoc will try to fetch
    the content via HTTP.  So you can do:
    'pandoc -r html -w markdown http://www.fsf.org'
    Adds dependency on HTTP.

  * Made HTML reader much more forgiving.
    + Incorporated idea (from HXT) that an element can be closed
      by an open tag for another element.
    + Javascript is partially parsed to make sure that a <script>
      section is not closed by a </script> in a comment or string.
    + More lenient non-quoted attribute values.
      Now we accept anything but a space character, quote, or <>.
      This helps in parsing e.g. www.google.com!
    + Bare & signs are now parsed as a string.  This is a common
      HTML mistake.
    + Skip a bare < in malformed HTML.

  * Removed html2markdown and hsmarkdown.
    + html2markdown is no longer needed, since you can now pass URI
      arguments to pandoc and directly convert web pages. (Note,
      however, that pandoc assumes the pages are UTF8. html2markdown
      made an attempt to guess the encoding and convert them.)
    + hsmarkdown is pointless -- a large executable that could be
      replaced by 'pandoc --strict'.

  * In most writers, an image in a paragraph by itself is now rendered
    as a figure, with the alt text as the caption. (Texinfo, HTML, RST,
    MediaWiki, Docbook, LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML.) Other images are
    rendered inline.

  * Depend on extensible-exceptions.  This allows pandoc to be compiled
    on GHC 6.8.

  * Added --base-header-level option.  For example, --base-header-level=2
    will change level 1 headers to level 2, level 2 to level 3, etc.
    Closes Debian #563416.

  * Incomplete support for RST tables (simple and grid).
    Thanks to Eric Kow. Colspans and rowspans not yet supported.

  * Added accessors (docTitle, docAuthors, docDate) to Meta type.

  * MediaWiki writer:  format links with relative URLs as wikilinks.
    The new rule:  If the link target is an absolute URL, an external
    link is created. Otherwise, a wikilink is created.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared: Export uniqueIdent, and don't allow tilde in
    identifier.  Note:  This may break links to sections that involve
    tildes.

  * Markdown(+lhs) reader:  handle "inverse bird tracks."
    Inverse bird tracks (<) are used for haskell example code that is not
    part of the literate Haskell program.  Resolves Issue #211.

  * LaTeX reader:
    + Recognize '\ ' (interword space).
    + Recognize nonbreaking space '~'.
    + Ignore \section, \pdfannot, \pdfstringdef.  Ignore alt title in
      section headers.  Don't treat \section as inline LaTeX.
      Resolves Issue #202.
    + LaTeX reader:  allow any special character to be escaped.
      Resolves Issue #221.
    + LaTeX reader: treat \paragraph and \subparagraph as level 4, 5
      headers.  Resolves Issue #207.

  * Use template variables for include-before/after.
    + These options now imply -s; previously they worked also in fragment
      mode.
    + Users can now adjust position of include-before and include-after
      text in the templates.
    + Default position of include-before moved back (as it was before 1.4)
      before table of contents.
    + Resolves Issue #217.

  * Don't print an empty table header: (all writers).
    Resolves Issue #210.

  * HTML, Docbook writer: Use tbody, thead, and cols in tables.

  * HTML writer: Don't include TOC div if table of contents is empty.

  * Markdown writer:  Fixed citations.
    Previously the markdown writer printed raw citation codes, e.g.
    [geach1970], rather than the expanded citations provided by
    citeproc, e.g. (Geach 1970). Now it prints the expanded citations.
    This means that the document produced can be processed as a markdown
    document without citeproc. Thanks to dsanson for reporting, and
    Andrea Rossato for the patch.

  * Improved and simplified title block in context template.
    Previously it caused an error if there was no title.
    This method should also be easier for users to customize.

  * Markdown reader:
    + Treat p., pp., sec., ch., as abbreviations in smart mode.
    + Disallow blank lines in inline code span.
    + Allow footnotes to be indented < 4 spaces.
      This fixes a regression.  A test case has been added.
    + Escape spaces in URLs as %20. Previously they were incorrectly
		  escaped as +, which is appropriate only for the query part of
			a URL. Resolves Issue #220.
    + Require two spaces after capital letter + period for list item.
      Otherwise "E. coli" starts a list. This might change the semantics
      of some existing documents, since previously the two-space
      requirement was only enforced when the second word started
      with a capital letter. But it is consistent with the existing
      documentation and follows the principle of least surprise.
      Resolves Issue #212.

  * LaTeX template: redefine labelwidth when using enumerate package.
    Otherwise the list labels (numbers) often extend past the left
    margin, which looks bad.

  * Mediawiki writer: Don't print a "== Notes ==" header before
    references.  This is too English-centric. Writers can provide their
    own header at the end of the document.

  * Promoted mediawiki headers.  '= head =' is now level 1, '== head =='
    level 2, etc.  This seems to be correct; it's only by convention
    that wikipedia articles have level 2 headers at most.
    Patch due to Eric Kow.

  * RunTests.hs: Set LANG to a UTF-8 locale. Use 'pandoc --data-dir=' so
    data files don't need to have been installed. This removes the need to
    set HOME.

  * HTML reader:
    + Handle spaces before <html>.  Resolves Issue #216.
    + Be forgiving in parsing a bare list within a list.
      The following is not valid xhtml, but the intent is clear:
      <ol>
      <li>one</li>
      <ol><li>sub</li></ol>
      <li>two</li>
      </ol>
      We'll treat the <ol> as if it's in a <li>.  Resolves Issue #215.

  * Updated INSTALL instructions.  cabal method is now promoted.

  * Updated markdown2pdf man page. It no longer says all pandoc options
    are accepted.

  * README/man pages: Removed advice to pipe through tidy before HTML
    reader.  This is obsolete, now that we have a forgiving HTML parser.

  * LaTeX writer: set numbersections template variable, so
    the section numbering options work again.

  * Removed obsolete Makefile.

  * Website: renamed index.txt.in -> index.txt.

  * New batch file to make-windows-installer.
    + Removed old Makefile.windows
    + Added make-windows-installer.bat
    + Modified default installer name in pandoc-setup.iss

  * Removed freebsd and macports directories.
    They are no longer up to date.

  * Setup.hs:
    + Made man page building sensitive to build verbosity.
    + Improved detection of highlighting support in test hook.
    + Install wrapper scripts into cabal bin directory.
    + Also simplified installManpages.
    + Setup.hs: install manpages to mandir.  Code borrowed from darcs.

  * Changed default of writerXeTeX to False.

  * HTML writer: don't include empty UL if --toc but no sections.
    Resolves Issue #199.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + If book, report, or memoir documentclass, use \chapter{}
      for first-level headers. Otherwise use \section{}.
    + Removed stLink, link template variable. Reason: we now always
      include hyperref in the template.

  * LaTeX template:

    + Only show \author if there are some.
    + Always include hyperref package. It is used not just for links but
      for toc, section heading bookmarks, footnotes, etc. Also added
      unicode=true on hyperref options.

  * markdown2pdf: always do at least two runs. hyperref bookmarks
    require this.

  * cabal file: Removed unneeded dependency on template-haskell.

  * Windows installer - fixed bug in data file locations.
    Resolves Issue #197.

  * Deprecated --custom-header in documentation.
    Removed old "Custom Headers" section in README.

pandoc (1.4)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Pandoc will now compile with either GHC 6.10 or 6.12.
    + Don't use System.IO.UTF8 when compiling with 6.12
    + Use -fno-warn-unused-do-bind option when compiling with 6.12

  * Replaced old headers with templates.  Now users have much more
    control over the way documents appear in --standalone mode,
    and writer code is simplified.  Resolves Issues #59, 147.
    Every effort has been made to retain backwards compatibilty.
    So, the --custom-header option should still work as before.

    + Added Text.Pandoc.Templates.  This provides functions for
      retrieving default templates and for rendering templates.
    + System templates (in the pandoc data directory) can be
      overridden by user templates in $HOME/.pandoc/templates.
    + Removed Text.Pandoc.DefaultHeaders.
    + Removed data/headers directory.
    + Added templates directory.
    + Added writerTemplate and writerVariables fields to WriterOptions.
    + Removed writerTitlePrefix, writerHeader fields from WriterOptions.
    + Changed --print-default-header to --print-default-template.
    + Added --template option.
    + Added -V/--variable option to set custom template variables.

  * Pandoc no longer requires Template Haskell.  Resolves Issue #186.

    + Removed need for TH in ODT module. Instead get reference.odt from
	  data file at run time.
    + Removed TH dependency from S5 module. S5 module now exports
      s5HeaderIncludes, which pandoc.hs includes if writer is s5 and
      standalone.
    + Refactored LaTeXMathML not to use TH.

  * Meta is now Meta [Inline] [[Inline]] [Inline] rather than
    Meta [Inline] [String] String. Authors and date in Meta are now lists
    of Inline elements rather than raw strings. This means that they can
    be formatted and can include footnotes. NOTE: This may be a breaking
    change for those using pandoc as a library.

  * Added readDataFile to Text.Pandoc.Shared.  This retrieves
    a data file from the user pandoc data directory (~/.pandoc
    on unix), or, if not found there, from the system data
    directory ($CABALDIR/shared/pandoc-VERSION/). All data
    files, including templates, LaTeXMathML.js, s5 styles,
	and reference.odt, can be overridden by the user.

  * s5 files moved from data/ui/default to s5/default.

  * Use unicode instead of entities in HTML and XML output.  Resolves
    Issue #163.

  * Prettier HTML footnote references:  put anchor inside sup,
    instead of other way.  Resolves Issue #191. Thanks to
    infinity0x.

  * Added --xetex option to pandoc and markdown2pdf.
    If --xetex is specified, pandoc produces latex suitable for
    processing by xelatex, and markdown2pdf uses xelatex to create
    the PDF. Resolves Issue #185.

  * RTF writer: multiple authors now occupy multiple paragraphs rather
    than using a line break.

  * Man writer: now the "--after-body" will come after the "AUTHORS"
    section, whereas before it would come before it.  This is a
    slight break from backwards compatibility.

  * Added --reference-odt option, so users may customize the styles
    used in pandoc-generated ODT files.  Users may also place a
	default reference.odt in the ~\.pandoc directory.

  * ODT writer:
    + Indented and line-broke styles.xml so it can be modified more easily.
    + Omitted some unnecessary style declarations.
    + Don't wrap text in OpenDocument writer.  The tags are too long, making
      wrapping ugly and pointless.

  * LaTeX reader: use \\ to separate multiple authors.

  * Markdown reader: use ; as separator between authors.
    This allows you to use ',' within author names: e.g. "John Jones, Jr."

  * S5 writer: use linebreak to separate authors in title page.

  * RST reader: Allow :: before lhs code block. The RST spec requires the
    :: before verbatim blocks. This :: should not be treated as literal
    colons. Resolves Issue #189.

  * Documented pandoc 1.3's new definition list syntax in README.
    (An oversight in the last release.)

  * markdown2pdf.hs:
    + interpret ! in a log as an error line.
    + --toc now works properly.

  * Changes in RunTests.hs:
    + Use the Diff library rather than a local copy of Diff.hs.
      (This vastly increases performance.) This change means that 'cabal
      test' presupposes that the Diff library is installed.
    + Removed tests/Diff.hs from cabal file.
    + Changed RunTests to use local environment. We need at least HOME, so
      pandoc can find its data directory.

  * Updated windows installer to install data files in the app directory.

  * Windows installer now installs portable wrappers hsmarkdown and
    markdown2pdf.

pandoc (1.3)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added --id-prefix option (Issue #41). This adds a prefix to all
    automatically generated HTML identifiers, which helps prevent
    duplicate identifiers when you're generating a fragment (say a blog
    post).

  * Added --indented-code-classes option.  This specifies classes
    to use for indented code blocks.  (Patch due to buttock; Issue #87.)

  * --number-sections now affects HTML output as well as ConTeXt and LaTeX
    (Issue #150).

  * Improved syntax for markdown definition lists (Issue #24).
    Definition lists are now more compatible with PHP Markdown Extra.
    + You can have multiple definitions for a term (but still not
      multiple terms).
    + Multi-block definitions no longer need a column before each block
      (indeed, this will now cause multiple definitions).
    + The marker no longer needs to be flush with the left margin,
      but can be indented at or two spaces.  Also, ~ as well as :
      can be used as the marker (this suggestion due to David
      Wheeler.)
    + There can now be a blank line between the term and the
      definitions.

  * Better looking simple tables.  Resolves Issue #180.
    + Markdown reader: simple tables are now given column widths of 0.
    + Column width of 0 is interpreted as meaning: use default column width.
    + Writers now include explicit column width information only
      for multiline tables.  (Exception:  RTF writer, which requires
      column widths.  In this case, columns are given equal widths,
      adding up to the text width.)
    + Simple tables should now look better in most output formats.

  * Allow markdown tables without headers (Issue #50).
    The new syntax is described in README. Also allow optional line of
    dashes at bottom of simple tables.

  * Compensate for width of final table column (Issue #144).

  * Treat a backslash followed by a newline as a hard line break
    in markdown.  Resolves Issue #154.  This is a nice alternative
	to markdown's "invisible" way of indicating hardline breaks
	using lines that end with two spaces.

  * Improved performance of markdown reader by ~10% by eliminating the
    need for a separate parsing pass for notes. Raw notes are now stored
    on the first pass (which parses references), then parsed when the
    note is inserted into the AST. The stateNotes field in ParserState
    is now a list of [(String, String)] pairs instead of [(String,
    [Block])].

  * In markdown reader, treat 4 or more * or _ in a row as literal
    text.  (Trying to parse long strings of * or _ as strong or emph
	leads to exponential performance problems.)

  * Markdown reader: Use + rather than %20 for spaces in URLs.

  * Fixed htmlComment parser, adding a needed 'try'.

  * Don't print raw HTML in man output.

  * Allow . _ and ~ in header identifiers.

  * Specially mark code blocks that were "literate" in the input.
    They can then be treated differently in the writers.  This allows
    authors to distinguish bits of the literate program they are writing
    from source code examples, even if the examples are marked as
    Haskell for highlighting.  (Issue #174.)

  * Modified html+lhs output to use "haskell" highlighter instead
    of "literateHaskell". The highlighting module now adds bird tracks
	after highlighting (for HTML output), if the code block has the
	"literate" class.  This gives better results, because kate's
    haskell highlighter is much better than the literateHaskell
    highlighter.

  * Fixed handling of footnotes in titles (HTML) and headers (LaTeX).
    (Issue #137.)

  * Support for "..code-block" directive in RST reader. Not core
    RST, but used in Sphinx for code blocks annotated with syntax
    information. Thanks to Luke Plant for the patch.

  * Added "head" to list of block-level HTML tags. Resolves
    Issue #108.

  * Added stripTags to Text.Pandoc.XML.  This is used in the HTML writer.

  * Set utf-8 encoding in texinfo headers.

  * Docbook writer: add ids to sections.  Use link for internal links.
    (Issue #60.)

  * Blank lines after lists in MediaWiki writer.

  * Properly handle commented-out list items in markdown.
    Resolves Issue #142.  Example:

    - a
    <!--
    - b
    -->
    - c

  * Changed heuristic in compactify. compactify has to decide whether a
    Para that ends a list is a Para intentionally, or just because of
    the blank lines at the end of every list. In the latter case the
    Para is turned to a Plain. The old heuristic was: change final Para
    to Plain iff the other items all end in Plain. This produces bad
    results when, for example, an item contains just a Plain and an HTML
    comment, as it does in the list above. The new heuristic: change
    final Para to Plain iff the other items don't contain a Para.

  * Added % as an rst underline character.  Resolves Issue #173.

  * Fix inline math parser so that \$ is allowed in math.
    Resolves Issue #169.

  * Translate \int (integral) into unicode when using unicode math
    method. Resolves Issue #177.

  * markdown2pdf.hs improvements:
    + Use System.IO.UTF8.
    + Print error messages on last attempt.
    + Do not create a backup when overwriting a PDF (Issue #166).
    + Accept --longopt=val options.
    + Added man/man1/markdown2pdf.1 to extra-tmp-files in cabal, so that
      it is properly cleaned.

  * Added haddock comments warning that readers assume \n line endings.

  * Updated COPYRIGHT file.

  * Makefile: Changed EXECSBASE so it doesn't pull in hsmarkdown &
    markdown2pdf. Otherwise strip tries to strip shell scripts when you
    install using 'make'.

  * Changed Makefile so it doesn't build Haskell wrappers.

  * Fixed Makefile so it doesn't try to build man pages in build-doc.

  * Install pcre3.dll in Windows install script; this allows us to
    package a version of pandoc with highlighting support.

pandoc (1.2.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed regression with --preserveTabs. Brought back optPreserveTabs.
    The trick of setting tabStop to 0 to mean "preserve tabs" had a bad
    side effect: strings of 0 spaces were interpreted as indentation.
    So, with --preserve-tabs, unindented paragraphs were treated as
    code. Resolves Issue #138.

  * HTML writer:  wrap sections in divs.  Resolves Issue #70.

    + hierarchicalize has been rationalized; it builds a hierarchical
      representation of the document from the headers, and simultaneously
      gives each section a unique identifier based on the heading title.
    + Identifiers are now attached to the divs rather than
      to the headers themselves.
    + Table of content backlinks go to the beginning of the table, rather
      than to the section reference that was clicked.
    + Code for constructing identifiers has been moved to Text.Pandoc.Shared
      from the HTML writer, since it is now consumed only by
      hierarchicalize.
    + In --strict mode, pandoc just prints bare headings, as before
      (unless --toc has been specified).
    + In s5 output, it does not wrap sections in divs, as that seems to
      confuse the s5 javascript.

  * Man writer: break lines at end of each sentence. groff expects this
    and treats '.' and '?' differently when followed by line ending as
    opposed to ordinary space. Also, don't escape periods. Instead, use
    zero-width character \& to avoid unwanted interpretation of periods
    at start of line. Resolves Issue #148.

  * Markdown writer:  Added '#' and '>' to list of characters to be
    escaped in markdown output.  Removed '<', as it is not an officially
    escapable character. This partially resolves Issue #96.

  * Make --smart the default for man output format. Otherwise we have
    trouble dividing lists of endlines into sentences.

  * DocBook writer: Use language attribute to indicate source language
    in code blocks.

  * RST reader:

    + Allow # to continue list, even if the list was started with an
      explicit marker. For example:

        A. my list
		#. continued

      Resolves Issue #140.
    + Allow continuation lines in line blocks. Also added test cases for
      line blocks for RST reader. Resolves Issue #149.
    + Allow explicit links with spaces in URL: `link <to this>`_

  * Improved LaTeX reader's coverage of math modes. Remove displaymath*
    (which is not in LaTeX) and recognize all the amsmath environments
    that are alternatives to eqnarray, namely equation, equation*,
    gather, gather*, gathered, multline, multline*, align, align*,
    alignat, alignat*, aligned, alignedat, split. Resolves Issue #103.
    Thanks to shreevatsa.public for the patch.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Allow -, _, :, . in markdown attribute names. These are legal in
      XML attribute names.
    + Use non-breaking spaces in abbreviations.
    + Markdown reader: improved efficiency of abbreviation parsing.
      Instead of a separate abbrev parser, we just check for
      abbreviations each time we parse a string. This gives a huge
      performance boost with -S. Resolves Issue #141.

  * Improved efficiency of shared parsers:  hexNum, htmlComment,
    whitespace, indentSpaces.

  * Export HTMLMathMethod in Text.Pandoc.

  * Export languagesByExtension in Text.Pandoc.Highlighting.

  * Added new Haskell version of markdown2pdf, due to
    Paulo Tanimoto.  This should be more portable than the old
	shell script.

  * Made 'pandoc -v' more explicit about compiler options.
    Resolves Issue #139.

  * pandoc.hs:  Made --strict compatible with --standalone, --toc.

  * Use Paths_pandoc to get version number, instead of hard-coding it
    into Text/Pandoc.hs.

pandoc (1.2)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added support for literate Haskell. lhs support is triggered by
    '+lhs' suffixes in formats. For example, 'latex+lhs' is literate
    Haskell LaTeX. '.lhs' files are treated by default as literate
    markdown.

    + Added stateLiterateHaskell to parser state.
    + Added parser for lhsCodeBlock to Markdown, RST, LaTeX readers.
    + Added parser for |inline lhs| to LaTeX reader.
    + Added writerLiterateHaskell to WriterOptions.
    + Added lhs support to Markdown, RST, LaTeX, HTML writers.
    + Added definition of code environment to LaTeX header.
    + Added tests (run only if highlighting support compiled in).
    + Documented lhs features in man page and README.

  * In Text.Pandoc.Definition, added processWith, processWithM,
    and queryWith, and deprecated processPandoc and queryPandoc
    for these more general functions.

  * Fixed bug in mediawiki writer:  improper closing tags in tables.
    Thanks to Benct Philip Jonsson for reporting the bug.

  * Added --email-obfuscation option.

    + Added writer option for email obfuscation.
    + Implemented email obfuscation options in HTML writer.
    + Added option to option parser.
    + Documented in README and pandoc man page.
    + Resolves Issue #97.

  * LaTeX writer: fixed bug with empty table cells.
    Resolves Issue #107.  Thanks to rodja.trappe for the patch.

  * Fixed bug with header spacing in Markdown and RST writers.
    A null header (Meta [] [] []) should not cause a blank line
    at the beginning of output.  But a blank line is needed between
    a non-null header and the main text.

  * Markdown reader: Relax spacing rules for $$ in display math. Now
    space and newlines are allowed after the opening $$ and before the
    closing $$. However, the display math cannot contain an entirely
    blank line. Resolves Issue #105.

  * Markdown reader: Gobble space after Plain blocks containing only
    raw html inline. Otherwise following header blocks are not parsed
    correctly, since the parser sees blank space before them. Resolves
    Issue #124.

  * Markdown reader: Allow " as well as '' to end a latex double-quote.

  * Conditionally depend on syb and base >= 4 if ghc >= 6.10.
    Resolves Issue #109.

  * Fixed problems in RST and markdown output due to bug in pretty-1.0.1.0

    + Added hang' function to Text.Pandoc.Shared; this will be used instead
      of hang, which doesn't work properly in pretty-1.0.1.0.  When pretty
      is upgraded, we can go back to hang.
      See  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/16687
    + Use hang' (and some different techniques) in RST and markdown writers.
      Some output is now a bit different.

  * Brought citeproc support up to date for citeproc-hs-0.2.
    (Patch by Andrea Rossato.)

  * Moved all haskell source to src subdirectory.  Renamed Main.hs to
    pandoc.hs.

  * Rewrote hsmarkdown in Haskell for portability (src/hsmarkdown.hs).
    For now, keeping the old shell script too.

  * Added TemplateHaskell to Extensions for executable, removed
    -threaded for library. Thanks to duncan.coutts for the bug report.
    Resolves Issue #121.

  * Moved some Extra-Source-Files to Data-Files.

  * Moved tabFilter to Shared.

  * In pandoc.hs, removed optPreserveTabs; instead, tabstop of 0 means
    preserve tabs.

  * Minor code cleanup based on hlint suggestions.

pandoc (1.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Main.hs:

    + Changed date on copyright message in Main.hs.
    + Have the '-v' option print syntax highlighting languages
      separated by commas, and wrapped in lines, instead of in five
      columns as before.

  * Added --jsmath option.  Resolves Issue #68.

    + Added --jsmath option to Main.hs
    + Added JsMath to HTMLMathMethod in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Handle math appropriately in HTML writer when JsMath selected.
    + Documented the option in README and man page.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:  Changed compactify to use a better heuristic
    for tight and loose lists. Final Para is changed to Plain if all
    other list items *end* with a Plain block. Addresses Issue #99.

  * HTML reader:

    + Added colons to protocols in unsanitaryURI. Closes Issue #88.
    + HTML reader: Don't interpret contents of <pre> blocks as markdown.
      Added rawVerbatimBlock parser.  Resolves Issue #94.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Allow URLs with spaces in them in links and references, but escape
      them as "%20".
    + Allow blank space at the end of horizontal rules.

  * RST reader: Modified 'unknownDirective' parser to handle comment
    blocks correctly, and added tests for comment blocks. Resolves Issue
    #86. Closes Debian Bug #500662.

  * HTML writer:

    + Include classes on tr elements in HTML output:
      "header", "odd", "even".  This allows tables to be styled with
      lines in alternating colors.  Resolves Issue #91.
    + Enclose all LaTeXMathML bits in <span class="LaTeX">.
      This prevents parts of the document that are not math from being
      interpreted as math by LaTeXMathML.js.

  * OpenDocument and ODT writers:  Added support for HorizontalRule elements,
    which were formerly ignored.  Resolves Issue #95.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:  Modified wrappedTeX to eliminate the line break
    between a footnote and immediately following nonspace characters in
    LaTeX and ConTeXt output. (This gets interpreted as a space, which
    is not desired in cases like "text^[note]---".)  Resolves Issue #93.

  * Windows installer: Don't require admin privileges to run
    installer.  Modified pandoc-setup.iss, and changed modpath.iss to
    modify HKCU path if user lacks admin privileges.  Also fixed case
    where oldpath is empty (previously this led to the new path
    beginning with a semicolon).

  * Updated INSTALL instructions for Arch packages and OS X install using
    cabal-install.

  * Removed the (now unneeded) debian directory.
    Removed empty Codec and System directories.

  * Moved odt-styles/ to data/.  Removed unneeded variable in Makefile.

  * Modified Setup.hs so that the "test" target returns an error status
    when tests fail, and "build" returns a success status if
    the build succeeds.  Resolves Issue #100.

  * Added BUGS to files in tarball.


pandoc (1.0.0.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Removed spurious reference to pdf output format from pandoc(1) man page.

pandoc (1.0)

  [ Andrea Rossato ]

  * Added new OpenDocument writer.

  * Added support for SmallCaps inline element.

  * Added support for integrating pandoc with citeproc-hs.

    + Added Cite element to definition and writers.
    + Added Text.Pandoc.Biblio module
    + Note: This support is included only if the 'citeproc'
      Cabal configuration flag is set.

  * Made Pandoc data structure an instance of Typeable.
    Added new processPandoc and queryPandoc functions, to query
    or transform matching elements in a Pandoc structure.

  [ Peter Wang ]

  * Added new Texinfo writer.

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Changes to Texinfo writer:

    + No space between paragraph and following @verbatim (provides more
      pleasing appearance in text formats)
    + Blank line consistently after list environments.
    + Removed deVerb.
    + Use @code instead of @verb for inline code (this solves the character
      escaping problem for texi2dvi and texi2pdf).
    + Added news of Texinfo writer to README.
    + Added Texinfo to list of formats in man page, and removed extra 'groff'.
    + Added texi & texinfo extensions to Main.hs, and fixed bug in determining
      default output extension.
    + Modified disallowedInNode in Texinfo writer to correct list of disallowed characters.

  * Added tests for OpenDocument writer.

  * Added ODT writer (using zip-archive library to package output of
    OpenDocument writer).  Added odt-styles directory with default ODT styles.

  * Added new mediawiki writer and tests.

  * Markdown reader: Added support for delimited code blocks, with optional
    syntax highlighting using highlighting-kate (if the 'highlighting'
    configuration option is selected).

    + Currently highlighting is supported only in the HTML writer.
    + Delimited code blocks can have attributes; using the language name as
      class triggers highlighting.
    + New Attributes parameter in CodeBlock structure.
    + --version now indicates whether syntax highlighting support is compiled
      in, and prints a list of supported languages

  * Removed debian directory. Pandoc is no longer a native debian package.

  * Changes to build process:  pandoc can now be built from the repository
    using Cabal.  No unix tools are needed (so, pandoc can be built on Windows
    without Cygwin).

    + Include shell scripts themselves in repo, rather than generating from wrappers.
      Removed wrappers directory and wrappers Makefile target.
    + Text/Pandoc/ASCIIMathML.hs, Text/Pandoc/DefaultHeaders.hs,
      and Text/Pandoc/Writers/S5.hs are no longer built in Makefile
      from templates in the templates/ directory. Instead, they use template
      haskell to read data at compile time from the relevant files in data/.
      Template haskell functions go in a new module, Text.Pandoc.TH.
    + man pages are now generated in Setup.hs hook, not by Makefile
    + Makefile 'tarball' target now calls Cabal's 'sdist'
    + Added "Extra-Source-Files" to pandoc.cabal, so sdist contains everything needed
    + Added "Build-Type" field to pandoc.cabal to avoid warning.
    + Added to "Extra-source-files" and "Extra-tmp-files" in pandoc.cabal,
      so 'sdist' and 'clean' will work properly.
    + Setup.hs now generates man pages in a postbuild hook.
    + Added dependency-checking to Setup.hs, so it only rebuilds things
      that need rebuilding.
    + Added 'library' and 'executable' configuration flags.
      Cabal can now be told to build just the library or just the executable.
    + CABALOPTS may now be specified with 'make' to pass Cabal configuration flags.
      For example:  CABALOPTS=-fhighlighting make

  * Rewrote test suite so it doesn't depend on perl or unix tools.

    + Replaced old runtests.pl with a Haskell script RunTests.hs.
    + Added Diff.hs module to be used by RunTests.hs instead of unix 'diff'.
    + Added test hook to Setup.hs, so tests may be run from cabal.
    + Changed Makefile's 'test' target to run tests via cabal.
    + Removed old generate.sh.
    + Since we no longer have 'sed' to filter out raw HTML sections
      from the docbook writer test, or raw LaTeX sections from the
      context writer test, we now just include these sections.
      They can be taken out if it is necessary to process the files.
    + Updated latex and context writer tests to remove extra spaces
      after '\\item'
    + Added a markdown table reader test.
    + Added markdown-reader-more.txt to test suite, for additional test cases
      for raw ConTeXt environments and more.

  * Compatibility fixes for CPP, Cabal, and haddock:

    + Use CPP in "Extensions" field in pandoc.cabal.
    + Removed use of backslash string continuations in source files.

  * Removed pandoc.cabal.ghc66.  We now require Cabal >= 1.2, GHC >= 6.8,
    base >= 3.

  * Require parsec < 3.
    The compatibility module in parsec 3.0.0 gives far worse performance than
    parsec 2.1.  Eventually pandoc will be upgraded to use the new bytestring
    version of parsec, and then we'll go to parsec 3.0.0.

  * Removed Text.Regex dependencies by rewriting using plain Haskell
    (Text.Pandoc.Writers.RTF, Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML, Main.hs)

  * Moved Text.Pandoc.Writers.DefaultHeaders -> Text.Pandoc.DefaultHeaders.

  * Makefile:

    + Added 'configure' as dependency of 'uninstall-all'.
      (It uses the Cabal build program.)
    + Makefile:  only use --with-hc-pkg if GHC_PKG is defined.
      Note that Cabal will automatically choose the ghc-pkg appropriate
      for the compiler selected, so normally specifying GHC by itself
      is sufficient.

  * Removed Text.Pandoc.UTF8 module; instead, depend on utf8-string and use
    its IO and conversion functions.

  * Added -Wall to ghc-options in pandoc.cabal.  Cleaned up modules so that
    everything is -Wall clean.

    + Added pragma to HTML writer to avoid deprecation warning for use of "start" attribute.
    + Added pragma to Text/Pandoc/Shared.hs to get rid of "orphan instance" warnings.
      (These are caused by the Lift instance for ByteString.)

  * Changed the comment used to replace unsafe HTML if sanitize-html option
    selected.

  * Made -c/--css option repeatable on the command line (like -H, -A, -B).

  * Moved XML-formatting functions to new unexported module Text.Pandoc.XML.

  * Escape '\160' as "&#160;", not "&nbsp;" in XML.
    "nbsp" isn't a predefined XML entity.

  * Fixed bug in RST reader, which would choke on: "p. one\ntwo\n".
    Added some try's in ordered list parsers.

  * Man writer:  don't escape " as \".

  * Allow newline before URL in markdown link references.  Resolves Issue #81.
    Added tests for this issue in new "markdown-reader-more" tests.
    Changed RunTests.hs to run these tests.

  * Support for display math.  Resolves Issue #47.

    + Added a DisplayMath/InlineMath selector to Math inlines.
    + Markdown parser yields DisplayMath for $$...$$.
    + LaTeX parser yields DisplayMath when appropriate.  Removed
      mathBlock parsers, since the same effect is achieved by the math
      inline parsers, now that they handle display math.
    + Writers handle DisplayMath as appropriate for the format.
    + Modified tests accordingly; added new tests for display math.

  * Use LaTeXMathML instead of ASCIIMathML.  LaTeXMathML is closer
    to LaTeX in its display of math, and supports many non-math LaTeX environments.

    + Changed -m option to use LaTeXMathML rather than ASCIIMathML.
    + Modified HTML writer to print raw TeX when LaTeXMathML is
      being used instead of suppressing it.
    + Removed ASCIIMathML files from data/ and added LaTeXMathML.
    + Replaced ASCIIMathML with LaTeXMathML in source files.
    + Modified README and pandoc man page source.
    + Added --latexmathml option (kept --asciimathml as a synonym
      for backwards compatibility)

  * Markdown reader: Parse setext headers before atx headers.
    Test case:
       # hi
       ====
    parsed by Markdown.pl as an H1 header with contents "# hi".

  * Markdown reader: Treat "mixed" lists the same way as Markdown.pl does.
    The marker on the first list item determines the type of the whole
    list.  Thus, a list like
       1. one
       -  two
       *  three
    gets parsed as a single ordered list.  (Previous versions of pandoc
    treated this as an ordered list with an unordered sublist.)

  * Markdown smart typography:

    + Em dashes no longer eat surrounding whitespace.  Resolves Issue #69.
    + Use nonbreaking spaces after known abbreviations in markdown parser.
      Thus, for example, "Mr. Brown" comes out as "Mr.~Brown" in LaTeX, and does
      not produce a sentence-separating space.  Resolves Issue #75.

  * Markdown writer: Print unicode \160 literally, rather than as &nbsp;.

  * Treat '\ ' in (extended) markdown as nonbreaking space.
    Print nonbreaking space appropriately in each writer (e.g. ~ in LaTeX).

  * The '--sanitize-html' option now examines URIs in markdown links
    and images, and in HTML href and src attributes.  If the URI scheme
    is not on a whitelist of safe schemes, it is rejected.  The main point
    is to prevent cross-site scripting attacks using 'javascript:' URIs.
    See http://www.mail-archive.com/markdown-discuss@six.pairlist.net/msg01186.html
    and http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html.  Resolves Issue #62.

  * HTML writer:

    + Override Text.XHtml's stringToHtml function,
      so that characters below 0xff are not converted to numerical entity
      references. Also convert '\160' to "&nbsp;". This should aid readability
      and editability of the HTML source. It does presuppose that the HTML
      will be served as UTF-8.
    + In code blocks, change leading newlines to <br /> tags.
      (Some browsers ignore them.)  Resolves Issue #71.
      See http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2008-May/001297.html
    + Use style attributes rather than css classes for strikethrough
      and ordered list styles.  This works better when fragments, rather than
      standalone documents, are generated.

  * HTML reader: Count anything that isn't a known block (HTML) tag as an
    inline tag (rather than the other way around).  Added "html", "head", and
    "body" to list of block tags.  Resolves Issue #66, allowing
    <lj> to count as an inline tag.

  * RTF writer: Fixed bug.  Extra spaces were being printed after emphasized,
    boldface, and other inline elements.  Resolves Issue #64.

  * LaTeX reader:  improvements in raw LaTeX parsing.

    + "loose punctuation" (like {}) parsed as Space
    + Para elements must contain more than Str "" and Space elements
    + Added parser for "\ignore" command used in literate haskell.
    + Reworked unknownCommand and rawLaTeXInline: when not in "parse raw"
      mode, these parsers simply strip off the command part and allow
      the arguments to be parsed normally.  So, for example,
      \blorg{\emph{hi}} will be parsed as Emph "hi" rather than
      Str "{\\emph{hi}}".
    + Parse lhs "code" environments as verbatim.
      Refactored parsers for verbatim environments.
    + Removed specialEnvironment parser.
    + parse '{}', if present, after \textless, \textgreater,
      \textbar, \textbackslash, \ldots.
    + Parse unescaped special characters verbatim rather than
      changing them to spaces.  This way arguments of unknown
      commands will appear in braces.

  * Parse raw ConTeXt environments as TeX in markdown reader.
    Resolves Issue #73.

  * Moved BlockWrapper and wrappedBlocksToDoc from ConTeXt writer to Shared.

  * Made some structural changes to parsing of raw LaTeX environments.
    Previously there was a special block parser for LaTeX environments.
    It returned a Para element containing the raw TeX inline. This has
    been removed, and the raw LaTeX environment parser is now used in the
    rawLaTeXInline parser. The effect is exactly the same, except that we
    can now handle consecutive LaTeX and ConTeXt environments not separated
    by spaces.  This new flexibility is required by the example in
    Issue #73:

        \placeformula \startformula
             L_{1} = L_{2}
        \stopformula

    API change: The LaTeX reader now exports rawLaTeXEnvironment' (which
    returns a string) rather than rawLaTeXEnvironment (which returns a block
    element). This is more likely to be useful in other applications.

  * Use \textsubscr instead of \textsubscript for LaTeX subscript macro.
    \textsubscript conflicts with a definition in the memoir class.
    Resolves Issue #65.

  * Removed unneeded space after "\\item" in LaTeX and ConTeXt output.

  * Added amsmath package to default LaTeX header. Resolves Issue #48.

  * Added \setupitemize[autointro] to ConTeXt header, to prevent orphaned
    list introduction lines.

  * Changed Float to Double in definition of Table element.
    (Double is more efficient in GHC.)

  * Fixed bug in Markdown parser:  regular $s triggering math mode.
    For example:  "shoes ($20) and socks ($5)."
    The fix consists in two new restrictions:

    + the $ that ends a math span may not be directly followed by a digit.
    + no blank lines may be included within a math span.

    Thanks to Joseph Reagle for noticing the bug.

  * Use Data.List's 'intercalate' instead of custom 'joinWithSep'.
    Removed 'joinWithSep' from Text.Pandoc.Shared.

  * Updated README and man pages.  Acknowledge contributors in README.
    Added paragraph to README about producing S5 with separate CSS/javascript.

  * Updated INSTALL to reflect new build system (including configuration
    options) and document new dependencies.  Added note to INSTALL that
    Cabal >= 1.2 is required for build.  Resolves Issue #74.

  * Fixed some haddock documentation errors.

  * Small fix to markdown2pdf man page: only input needs to be piped through iconv.

pandoc (0.46) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Made -H, -A, and -B options cumulative: if they are specified
    multiple times, multiple files will be included.

  * Added optional HTML sanitization using a whitelist.
    When this option is specified (--sanitize-html on the command line),
    unsafe HTML tags will be replaced by HTML comments, and unsafe HTML
    attributes will be removed.  This option should be especially useful
    for those who want to use pandoc libraries in web applications, where
    users will provide the input.

    + Main.hs:  Added --sanitize-html option.

    + Text.Pandoc.Shared:  Added stateSanitizeHTML to ParserState.

    + Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML:
      - Added whitelists of sanitaryTags and sanitaryAttributes.
      - Added parsers to check these lists (and state) to see if a given
        tag or attribute should be counted unsafe.
      - Modified anyHtmlTag and anyHtmlEndTag to replace unsafe tags
        with comments.
      - Modified htmlAttribute to remove unsafe attributes.
      - Modified htmlScript and htmlStyle to remove these elements if
        unsafe.

    + Modified README and man pages to document new option.

  * Improved handling of email addresses in markdown and reStructuredText.
    Consolidated uri and email address parsers.  (Resolves Issue #37.)

    + New emailAddress and uri parsers in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
      - uri parser uses parseURI from Network.URI.
      - emailAddress parser properly handles email addresses with periods
        in them.

    + Removed uri and emailAddress parsers from Text.Pandoc.Readers.RST
      and Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Fixed emph parser so that "*hi **there***" is parsed as a Strong
      nested in an Emph. (A '*' is only recognized as the end of the
      emphasis if it's not the beginning of a strong emphasis.)

    + Moved blockQuote parser before list parsers for performance.

    + Modified 'source' parser to allow backslash-escapes in URLs.
      So, for example, [my](/url\(1\)) yields a link to /url(1).
      Resolves Issue #34.

    + Disallowed links within links. (Resolves Issue #35.)
      - Replaced inlinesInBalanced with inlinesInBalancedBrackets, which
        instead of hard-coding the inline parser takes an inline parser
        as a parameter.
      - Modified reference and inlineNote to use inlinesInBalancedBrackets.
      - Removed unneeded inlineString function.
      - Added inlineNonLink parser, which is now used in the definition of
        reference.
      - Added inlineParsers list and redefined inline and inlineNonLink parsers
        in terms of it.
      - Added failIfLink parser.

    + Better handling of parentheses in URLs and quotation marks in titles.
      - 'source' parser first tries to parse URL with balanced parentheses;
        if that doesn't work, it tries to parse everything beginning with
        '(' and ending with ')'.
      - source parser now uses an auxiliary function source'.
      - linkTitle parser simplified and improved, under assumption that it
        will be called in context of source'.

    + Make 'block' conditional on strictness state, instead of using
      failIfStrict in block parsers. Use a different ordering of parsers
      in strict mode (raw HTML block before paragraph) for performance.
      In non-strict mode use rawHtmlBlocks instead of htmlBlock.
      Simplified htmlBlock, since we know it's only called in strict
      mode.

    + Improved handling of raw HTML.  (Resolves Issue #36.)
      - Tags that can be either block or inline (e.g. <ins>) should
        be treated as block when appropriate and as inline when
        appropriate. Thus, for example,
        <ins>hi</ins>
        should be treated as a paragraph with inline <ins> tags, while
        <ins>
        hi
        </ins>
        should be treated as a paragraph within <ins> tags.
      - Moved htmlBlock after para in list of block parsers.  This ensures
        that tags that can be either block or inline get parsed as inline
        when appropriate.
      - Modified rawHtmlInline' so that block elements aren't treated as
        inline.
      - Modified para parser so that paragraphs containing only HTML tags and
        blank space are not allowed.  Treat these as raw HTML blocks instead.

    + Fixed bug wherein HTML preceding a code block could cause it to
      be parsed as a paragraph.  The problem is that the HTML parser
      used to eat all blank space after an HTML block, including the
      indentation of the code block.  (Resolves Issue #39.)
      - In Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML, removed parsing of following space
        from rawHtmlBlock.
      - In Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown, modified rawHtmlBlocks so that
        indentation is eaten *only* on the first line after the HTML
        block.  This means that in
        <div>
             foo
        <div>
        the foo won't be treated as a code block, but in
        <div>

            foo

        </div>
        it will.  This seems the right approach for least surprise.

  * RST reader:

    + Fixed bug in parsing explicit links (resolves Issue #44).
      The problem was that we were looking for inlines until a '<' character
      signaled the start of the URL; so, if you hit a reference-style link,
      it would keep looking til the end of the document.  Fix:  change
      inline => (notFollowedBy (char '`') >> inline).  Note that this won't
      allow code inlines in links, but these aren't allowed in resT anyway.

    + Cleaned up parsing of reference names in key blocks and links.
      Allow nonquoted reference links to contain isolated '.', '-', '_', so
      so that strings like 'a_b_' count as links.

    + Removed unnecessary check for following link in str.
      This is unnecessary now that link is above str in the definition of
      'inline'.

  * HTML reader:

    + Modified rawHtmlBlock so it parses </html> and </body> tags.
      This allows these tags to be handled correctly in Markdown.
      HTML reader now uses rawHtmlBlock', which excludes </html> and </body>,
      since these are handled in parseHtml.  (Resolves Issue #38.)

    + Fixed bug (emph parser was looking for `<IT>` tag, not `<I>`).

    + Don't interpret contents of style tags as markdown.
      (Resolves Issue #40.)
      - Added htmlStyle, analagous to htmlScript.
      - Use htmlStyle in htmlBlockElement and rawHtmlInline.
      - Moved "script" from the list of tags that can be either block or
        inline to the list of block tags.

    + Modified rawHtmlBlock to use anyHtmlBlockTag instead of anyHtmlTag
      and anyHtmlEndTag.  This fixes a bug in markdown parsing, where
      inline tags would be included in raw HTML blocks.

    + Modified anyHtmlBlockTag to test for (not inline) rather than
      directly for block.  This allows us to handle e.g. docbook in
      the markdown reader.

  * LaTeX reader:  Properly recognize --parse-raw in rawLaTeXInline.
    Updated LaTeX reader test to use --parse-raw.

  * HTML writer:

    + Modified rules for automatic HTML header identifiers to
      ensure that identifiers begin with an alphabetic character.
      The new rules are described in README.  (Resolves Issue #33.)

    + Changed handling of titles in HTML writer so you don't get
      "titleprefix - " followed by nothing.

  * ConTeXt writer: Use wrappers around Doc elements to ensure proper
    spacing.  Each block element is wrapped with either Pad or Reg.
    Pad'ed elements are guaranteed to have a blank line in between.

  * RST writer:

    + Refactored RST writer to use a record instead of a tuple for state,
      and to include options in state so it doesn't need to be passed as
      a parameter.

    + Use an interpreted text role to render math in restructuredText.
      See http://www.american.edu/econ/itex2mml/mathhack.rst for the
      strategy.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Debian packaging changes:

    + Remove the empty 'include' directory in -dev package, which lintian
      complains about.
    + Bump Standarts-Version to 3.7.3.
    + Use new 'Homepage:' field to specify the upstream URL on suggestion of
      lintian.

pandoc (0.45) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Simplified parsing of reference keys and notes in markdown and RST
    readers: The Reference data structure from Text.Pandoc.Shared is no
    longer needed, since referenceKey and noteBlock parses return strings
    (as many blank lines as were occupied by the key or note) and update
    state themselves.  getPosition and setPosition are now used to ensure
    that error messages will give the correct line number. This yields
    cleaner (and slightly faster) code, with more accurate parsing error
    messages.

  * Added new Math inline element:

    + Markdown and LaTeX readers now convert TeX math into Math elements,
      not TeX.
    + This allows math to be treated differently from raw TeX in output.
      TeX elements are no longer printed in output formats other than
      Markdown, LaTeX, and ConTeXt.  But Math elements are always printed.

  * New default handling of math in writers:

    + New module Text.Pandoc.Readers.TeXMath exports readTeXMath, which
      parses raw TeX math and outputs a string of Pandoc inlines that
      tries to render it as far as possible using unicode characters,
      lapsing into literal TeX when needed.
    + readTeXMath is now used for default HTML output in HTML, S5, RTF,
      and Docbook, if no other method for displaying math in HTML is
      specified.  Enclosing $'s are no longer printed by default.
    + By default, math is put inside `<span class="math">`. This way it can be
      distinguished from the surrounding text, e.g. put in a different
      font.

  * New --gladtex and --mimetex options for display of math in HTML:

    + If --gladtex is specified, math is output between `<eq>` tags, so
      it can be processed by gladTeX.
    + If --mimetex is specified, math is put in `<img>` tags with a link
      to the mimetex CGI script (or any other script that takes TeX math
      as input and outputs an image).  The URL of the script may be
      specified, but defaults to /cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi.
    + HTMLMathMethod structure in WriterOptions keeps track of how to
      display math in HTML output.
    + Updated README with a description of the four options for displaying
      math in HTML.

  * HTML reader:

    + Fixed bug: parser for minimized attributes should not swallow
      trailing spaces.
    + Simplified HTML attribute parsing.
    + Changed parsing of code blocks in HTML reader:  `<code>` tag is no
      longer needed. `<pre>` suffices. All HTML tags in the code block
      (e.g. for syntax highlighting) are skipped, because they are not
      portable to other output formats. A `<code>...</code>` block not
      surrounded by `<pre>` now counts as inline HTML, not a code block.
    + Remove just one leading and one trailing newline from contents of
      `<pre>...</pre>` in codeBlock parser.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Removed support for box-style block quotes.
    + Require space before title in links and references.
      This fixes a bug in parsing URLs like http://silly/url(withparen).
    + Improved and simplified setextHeader parser.
    + Fixed logic in smart quote parsing, adding some needed 'try'
      statements.
    + Fixed smart quote parsing so that unicode characters 8216 and 8217
      are recognized as single quotes, and 8220 and 8221 as double quotes.

  * RST reader:

    + Fixed bug in parsing of code blocks. Previously a full tab indent
      was required, but RST allows code to be indented any amount.
      Resolves Issue #27.
    + Allow field lists to be indented.
    + Parse the contents of field lists instead of treating as a raw string.
    + Represent field lists as definition lists instead of blockquotes.
    + Fixed bug in which metadata would be overridden if the document
      contained multiple field lists.
    + Parse fields associated with '.. image::' blocks, and use 'alt'
      field, if given, for image alt and title attributes.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Modified specialChar so that '"' characters are parsed.
    + Fixed a bug in parsing of \[ \] math blocks (thanks to Mark Kalderon).

  * HTML writer:

    + Changes in handling of math (see above).
    + Don't produce HTML for table of contents if there are
      no headers. (This would be an empty list, which is invalid XHTML.)

  * Markdown writer:

    + Don't print title attribute if title is empty. (This differs from
      the behavior of Markdown.pl, and agrees with PHP Markdown. But John
      Gruber has indicated that he prefers this behavior.) Adjusted test
      suite accordingly.
    + Fixed incorrect line wrapping in paragraphs including hard line
      breaks. Resolves Issue #25.
    + Fixed bug in markdown writer:  If an ordered list item began with
      a marker greater than 3 characters in width, and the item took more
      than one line, it would appear on the line after the list marker,
      e.g.:

          (12)
              My list item.
              Multiline.

      Now it works as follows:

          (12) My list item.
              Multiline.

  * RST writer

    + Fixed bug in RST writer's handling of ordered lists. Previously,
      list items with multiple lines would not always line up with
      single-line list items. Now, list items are nested the length of
      the list marker + 1. This looks better and ensures that list items
      all line up. (Note that list markers are padded to the length of
      the longest list marker in the series.)
    + Use 3-space indent for unordered lists.
    + If label for a link reference contains a colon, surround it by `
      signs so it won't be interpreted as the end of the link label.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Cleaner output for footnotes. Footnotes now always begin on a new
      line, and the final } is on a line by itself only when it needs to
      be (i.e. only when the note ends with a Verbatim environment).
    + Added writer options to state, so state doesn't need to be passed as
      a parameter.
    + Text wrapping now provided, using wrapTeXIfNeeded.

  * ConTeXt writer:  many improvements for more idiomatic ConTeXt output
    (thanks to Idris Samawi Hamid for suggestions).

    + PrettyPrint module now used for output.
    + Writer options are now in state, so they don't have to be passed as
      a parameter.
    + Text wrapping now provided, using wrapTeXIfNeeded.
    + Better treatment of footnotes:  footnotes are always on lines by
      themselves, and the final } is on a line by itself only when
      it needs to be (after \stoptyping).
    + Use \subject, \subsubject, ... or \section, \subsection, ... for headings,
      depending on whether --number-sections option is selected.
    + Extra blank line inserted after \stopitemize
    + Use new, "official" definition of blockquote environment. Also, use
      blank line after \startblockquote to balance blank line at the end.
    + Both itemized and enumerated lists are now generated using
      \start-stopitemize, with appropriate options. Removed definitions
      of ltxenum and ltxitem, which are no longer needed. Provided
      defaults for itemized lists in the preamble. State keeps track of
      ordered list level, so that when default numbering is specified,
      the appropriate scheme can be used.
    + Changed \useurl to \useURL.
    + Changed link color from red to blue.
    + Use \subsubsubsubsection etc., since these are supported
      (up to at least sub x 5).

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:

    + Save and restore position in parseFromString, so that accurate
      error messages can be given.
    + Improved efficiency of romanNumeral parser.
    + Added wrappedTeX and wrapTeXIfNeeded functions.  These ensure
      that footnotes occur on lines by themselves (to make them
      easier to see and move) and do not screw up line wrapping.

  * Text.Pandoc.UTF8:  modified fromUTF8 to strip out the BOM
    if present.  Windows Notepad and other applications insert a
    BOM at the beginning of a UTF8 file.

  * Main.hs (tabFilter): Treat '\r' at end of line as newline (in
    addition to "\r\n" and '\n').

  * Added a writer option for wrapped text and a command-line option
    '--no-wrap', which disables text wrapping and minimizes whitespace
    in HTML. (Resolves Issue #26.)

    + Added support for '--no-wrap' to Main.hs.
    + Added wrapIfNeeded function to Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Use wrapIfNeeded instead of wrapped in the RST, Man, Docbook, and
      Markdown writers.
    + Added render and renderFragment helpers to HTML writer.

  * Modified html2markdown to run tidy only if the HTML cannot be
    parsed. Previously html2markdown piped all input through tidy
    before passing it to pandoc. This caused problems on certain pages
    (e.g. http://daringfireball.com/markdown) which have well-formed
    XHTML that causes tidy to choke. The solution is to pipe through
    tidy only if pandoc cannot parse the input by itself. This means
    that a temp file is now always used, even when input comes from a
    local file or standard input.

  * Removed 'version' constant from Main.hs; added 'pandocVersion' to
    Text.Pandoc library.

  * pandoc.cabal:

    + Modified to work with GHC 6.8 and Cabal configurations. (For GHC
      6.8, pretty and containers must be added to Build-Depends, and it
      is desirable to use the -O2 compiler option.)  Cabal configurations
      allows one to select options depending on the compiler version.
      For GHC 6.6, the splitBase option can be disabled.
    + pandoc.cabal.ghc66 is provided for users with older versions of
      Cabal, which do not support configurations.
    + Use Ghc-Prof-Options to ensure that '-auto-all' is used when
      '--enable-(executable|library)-profiling' is specified. Updated
      PROFILING instructions accordingly.

  * Makefile:

    + Makefile now checks GHC version. If GHC is 6.6, pandoc.cabal.ghc66
      is copied to pandoc.cabal, and the old pandoc.cabal is copied
      to pandoc.cabal.orig. Otherwise, pandoc.cabal is copied to
      pandoc.cabal.orig but otherwise unmodified. This way, the Makefile
      will work properly with either GHC 6.6 or 6.8.
    + Changed BUILDCONF to point to dist/setup-config, not .setup-config.
      This is where current versions of Cabal put it.
    + Added $(BUILDCMD) target, so setup doesn't get compiled every time.
    + Removed dependency of templates on ./templates, which is circular
      now that templates is a subdirectory of the top-level.

  * MacPorts Portfile:

    + Modified to install the pandoc library in addition to programs.
    + Installation must be done manually rather than using Makefile's
      install-all.
    + Note that the library must be registered in the activate phase,
      after the library files have been copied out of the destroot.
      Cabal generates a 'register.sh' script that will do this.

  * debian/control: Added libghc6-network-dev, libghc6-xhtml-dev, and
    libghc6-mtl-dev as dependencies for libghc6-pandoc-dev.
    Closes: #445235

  * debian/rules:  Converted to UTF-8.

  * Changed pandoc home page to http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/.

  * Updated ASCIIMathML.js to latest version.

  * Directory structure:

    + Moved everything from src into the top-level directory.
    + Changed references to source directory in Makefile and
      pandoc.cabal.*.
    + Moved ASCIIMathML.js, headers, and ui into templates directory.
    + Modified fillTemplates.pl to reflect new paths.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Makefile: Fixed the issue of having two copies of the library
    documentation under some usage scenarios.

  * Replaced 'ghc' with '$(GHC)' in Makefile, and made GHC
    and GHC_PKG configurable through the environment, to support
    unusual ghc installations.  For example:
    GHC=/opt/ghc/bin/ghc GHC_PKG=/opt/ghc/bin/ghc-pkg make

pandoc (0.44) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed bug in HTML writer:  when --toc was used, anchors were put around
    headers, which is invalid XHTML (block content within inline element).
    Now the anchors are put inside the header tags.  Resolves Issue #23.

  * Added xmlns attribute to html element in html writer tests.
    This attribute is added by more recent versions of the
    xhtml library (>= 3000), and is required for valid XHTML.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * On configure, compile 'Setup.hs' to 'setup' and use 'setup' as the build
    command instead of 'runhaskell', which, on some platforms (such as s390,
    alpha, m68k), throws the following error:

        runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/usr
        ghc-6.6.1: not built for interactive use

    This causes a serious FTBFS bug.  Closes: #440668.

pandoc (0.43) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * The focus of this release is performance.  The markdown parser
    is about five times faster than in 0.42, based on benchmarks
    with the TextMate manual.

  * Main.hs: Replaced CRFilter and tabFilter with single function
    tabFilter, which operates on the whole string rather than breaking
    it into lines, and handles dos-style line-endings as well as tabs.

  * Added separate LaTeX reader and native reader tests; removed
    round-trip tests.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:

    + Removed tabsToSpaces and tabsInLine (they were used only in Main.hs.)
    + General code cleanup (to elimante warnings when compiling with -Wall.)
    + Added 'wrapped' function, which helps wrap text into paragraphs,
      using the prettyprinting library.
    + Rewrote charsInBalanced and charsInBalanced'.
        - Documented restriction: open and close must be distinct characters.
        - Rearranged options for greater efficiency.
        - Bug fix: Changed inner call to charsInBalanced inside
          charsInBalanced' to charsInBalanced'.
    + anyLine now requires that the line end with a newline (not eof).
      This is a harmless assumption, since we always add newlines to the
      end of a block before parsing with anyLine, and it yields a 10% speed
      boost.
    + Removed unnecessary 'try' in anyLine.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' from romanNumeral parser.
    + Use notFollowedBy instead of notFollowedBy' in charsInBalanced.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' in parseFromString.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' from stringAnyCase.  (Now it behaves
      like 'string'.)
    + Changed definition of 'enclosed' in Text.Pandoc.Shared so that
      'try' is not automatically applied to the 'end' parser. Added
      'try' in calls to 'enclosed' where needed. Slight speed increase.

  * Writers:

    + Replaced individual wrapping routines in RST, Man, and Markdown
      writers with 'wrapped' from Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Rewrote LaTeX writer to use the prettyprinting library,
      so we get word wrapping, etc.
    + Modified latex writer tests for new latex writer using prettyprinter.
    + Fixed bug in LaTeX writer: autolinks would not cause
      '\usepackage{url}' to be put in the document header. Also, changes
      to state in enumerated list items would be overwritten.
    + In Markdown writer, escape paragraphs that begin with ordered list
      markers, so they don't get interpreted as ordered lists.

  * Text.Pandoc.Reades.LaTeX:

    + Fixed bug in LaTeX reader, which wrongly assumed that the roman
      numeral after "enum" in "setcounter" would consist entirely of
      "i"s. 'enumiv' is legitimate.
    + LaTeX command and environment names can't contain numbers.
    + Rearranged order of parsers in inline for slight speed improvement.
    + Added '`' to special characters and 'unescapedChar'.

  * Text.Pandoc.Readers.RST:

    + Removed unneeded try's in RST reader; also minor code cleanup.
    + Removed tabchar.
    + Rearranged parsers in inline (doubled speed).

  * Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown:

    + Skip notes parsing if running in strict mode. (This yields a nice
      speed improvement in strict mode.)
    + Simplify autolink parsing code, using Network.URI to test for
      URIs. Added dependency on network library to debian/control and
      pandoc.cabal.
    + More perspicuous definition of nonindentSpaces.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' in 'rawLine'.
    + Combined linebreak and whitespace into a new whitespace parser, to
      avoid unnecessary reparsing of space characters.
    + Removed unnecessary 'try' in 'codeBlock', 'ellipses', 'noteMarker',
      'multilineRow', 'dashedLine', 'rawHtmlBlocks'.
    + Use lookAhead in parsers for setext headers and definition lists
      to see if the next line begins appropriately; if not, don't waste
      any more time parsing.
    + Don't require blank lines after code block. (It's sufficient to
      end code block with a nonindented line.)
    + Changed definition of 'emph': italics with '_' must not
      be followed by an alphanumeric character. This is to help
      prevent interpretation of e.g. `[LC_TYPE]: my_type` as
      `[LC<em>TYPE]:my</em>type`.
    + Improved Markdown.pl-compatibility in referenceLink: the two parts
      of a reference-style link may be separated by one space, but not
      more... [a] [link], [not]    [a link].
    + Fixed markdown inline code parsing so it better accords with
      Markdown.pl: the marker for the end of the code section is a clump
      of the same number of `'s with which the section began, followed
      by a non-` character. So, for example,
         ` h ``` i ` -> `<code>h ``` i</code>`.
    + Split 'title' into 'linkTitle' and 'referenceTitle', since the
      rules are slightly different.
    + Rewrote 'para' for greater efficiency.
    + Rewrote link parsers for greater efficiency.
    + Removed redundant 'referenceLink' in definition of inline (it's
      already in 'link').
    + Refactored escapeChar so it doesn't need 'try'.
    + Refactored hrule for performance in Markdown reader.
    + More intelligent rearranging of 'inline' so that most frequently
      used parsers are tried first.
    + Removed tabchar parser, as whitespace handles tabs anyway.

  * Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences:

    + Refactored.
    + Removed unnecessary 'try's for a speed improvement.
    + Removed unnecessary '&' and ';' from the entity table.

  * Build process:

    + Makefile: Get VERSION from cabal file, not Main.hs.
    + Modified MacPorts Portfile:
        - Depend on haddock
        - Build and install libraries and library documentation in
          addition to pandoc executable
        - Added template item for md5 sum in Portfile.in.
        - Incorporated changes from MacPorts repository (r28278).
    + FreeBSD port:  Don't try to generate distinfo in Makefile.
      It can be made using 'make makesum' in FreeBSD.
    + Make both freebsd and macports targets depend on tarball.

  * Website and documentation:

    + Updated INSTALL instructions.
    + Added pandocwiki demo to website.
    + Removed local references to Portfile, since pandoc is now in the
      MacPorts repository.

pandoc (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Main.hs: Use utf8 conversion on the extra files loaded with
    the -H, -C, -B, and -A options.  This fixes problems with unicode
    characters in these files.

  * Exposed Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML, since it is imported in
    Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML and without it we get a linking error when
    using the library.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Added new rule for enhanced markdown ordered lists: if the list
      marker is a capital letter followed by a period (including a
      single-letter capital roman numeral), then it must be followed by
      at least two spaces. The point of this is to avoid accidentally
      treating people's initials as list markers: a paragraph might begin,
      "B. Russell was an English philosopher," and this shouldn't be
      treated as a list.  Documented change in README.
    + Blocks that start with "p. " and a digit are no longer treated
      as ordered lists (it's a page number).
    + Added a needed 'try' to listItem.
    + Removed check for a following setext header in endline.
      A full test is too inefficient (doubles benchmark time), and the
      substitute we had before is not 100% accurate.
    + Don't use Code elements for autolinks if --strict specified.

  * LaTeX writer:  When a footnote ends with a Verbatim environment, the
    close } of the footnote cannot occur on the same line or an error occurs.
    Fixed this by adding a newline before the closing } of every footnote.

  * HTML writer:
    + Removed incorrect "{}" around style information in HTML tables.
      Column widths now work properly in HTML.
    + If --strict option is specified (and --toc is not), don't include
      identifiers in headers, for better Markdown compatibility.

  * Build process:

    + Separated $(web_dest) and website targets.
    + In website, index.txt is now constructed from template index.txt.in.
    + Added freebsd target to Markefile. This creates the freebsd Makefile
      from Makefile.in, and creates distinfo.  Removed Makefile and distinfo
      from the repository.
    + Added macport target to Makefile. Portfile is built from template
      Portfile.in.
    + Removed OSX package targets.  (Too many difficulties involving
      dependencies on dynamic libraries.)
    + More complete INSTALL instructions for all architectures.

  * Website:
    + Added a programming demo, pandocwiki.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Do not forget to close pandoc's ITP.  Closes: #391666

pandoc (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed bugs in HTML reader:
    + Skip material at end *only if* `</html>` is present (previously,
      only part of the document would be parsed if an error was
      found; now a proper error message is given).
    + Added new constant eitherBlockOrInline with elements that may
      count either as block-level or as inline. Modified isInline and
      isBlock to take this into account.
    + Modified rawHtmlBlock to accept any tag (even an inline tag):
      this is innocuous, because rawHtmlBlock is tried only if a regular
      inline element can't be parsed.
    + Added a necessary 'try' in definition of 'para'.

  * Fixed bug in markdown ordered list parsing.  The problem was that
    anyOrderedListStart did not check for a space following the
    ordered list marker.  So in 'A.B. 2007' the parser would be
    expecting a list item, but would not find one, causing an error.
    Fixed a similar bug in the RST reader.  Resolves Issue #22.

  * Refactored RST and Markdown readers using parseFromString.

  * LaTeX reader will now skip anything after \end{document}.

  * Fixed blockquote output in markdown writer: previously, block
    quotes in indented contexts would be indented only in the first
    line.

  * Added note to INSTALL about variations in versions of the xhtml
    library that can lead to failed tests (thanks to Leif LeBaron).

pandoc (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added two new output formats: groff man pages and ConTeXt. By
    default, output files with extensions ".ctx" and ".context" are
    assumed to be ConTeXt, and output files with single-digit extensions
    are assumed to be man pages.

  * Enhanced ordered lists (documented in README, under Lists):
    + The OrderedList block element now stores information about
      list number style, list number delimiter, and starting number.
    + The readers parse this information when possible.
    + The writers use this information to style ordered lists.
    + The enhancement can be disabled using the --strict option.

  * Added support for tables (with a new Table block element). Two kinds
    of tables are supported: a simple table with one-line rows, and a
    more complex variety with multiline rows. All output formats are
    supported, but only markdown tables are parsed at the moment. The
    syntax is documented in README.

  * Added support for definition lists (with a new DefinitionList block
    element). All output and input formats are supported. The syntax is
    documented in README.

  * Added support for superscripts and subscripts (with new Superscript
    and Subscript inline elements).  All input and output
    formats.  The syntax is documented in README.

  * Added support for strikeout (with a new Strikeout inline element).
    All input and output formats are supported. Thanks to Bradley Kuhn,
    who contributed a patch. The syntax is documented in README. Resolves
    Issue #18.

  * Added a --toc|--table-of-contents option.  This causes an automatically
    generated table of contents (or an instruction that creates one) to
    be inserted at the beginning of the document. Not supported in S5,
    DocBook, or man page writers.

  * Modified the -m|--asciimathml option:

    + If an optional URL argument is provided, a link is inserted
      instead of the contents of the ASCIIMathML.js script.
    + Nothing is inserted unless the document actually contains
      LaTeX math.

  * Removed Blank block element as unnecessary.

  * Removed Key and Note blocks from the Pandoc data structure. All
    links are now stored as explicit links, and note contents are
    stored with the (inline) notes.

    + All link Targets are now explicit (URL, title) pairs; there
      is no longer a 'Ref' target.
    + Markdown and RST parsers now need to extract data from key and
      note blocks and insert them into the relevant inline elements.
      Other parsers have been simplified, since there is no longer any need
      to construct separate key and note blocks.
    + Markdown, RST, and HTML writers need to construct lists of
      notes; Markdown and RST writers need to construct lists of link
      references (when the --reference-links option is specified); and
      the RST writer needs to construct a list of image substitution
      references. All writers have been rewritten to use the State monad
      when state is required.
    + Several functions (generateReference, keyTable,
      replaceReferenceLinks, replaceRefLinksBlockList, and some auxiliaries
      used by them) have been removed from Text.Pandoc.Shared, since
      they are no longer needed. New functions and data structures
      (Reference, isNoteBlock, isKeyBlock, isLineClump) have been
      added. The functions inTags, selfClosingTag, inTagsSimple, and
      inTagsIndented have been moved to the DocBook writer, since that
      is now the only module that uses them. NoteTable is now exported
      in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Added stateKeys and stateNotes to ParserState; removed stateKeyBlocks,
      stateKeysUsed, stateNoteBlocks, stateNoteIdentifiers, stateInlineLinks.
    + Added writerNotes and writerReferenceLinks to WriterOptions.

  * Added Text.Pandoc module that exports basic readers, writers,
    definitions, and utility functions. This should export everything
    needed for most uses of Pandoc libraries. The haddock documentation
    includes a short example program.

  * Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML is no longer an exported module.

  * Added Text.Pandoc.Blocks module to help in printing markdown
    and RST tables.  This module provides functions for working with
    fixed-width blocks of text--e.g., placing them side by side, as
    in a table row.

  * Refactored to avoid reliance on Haskell's Text.Regex library, which
    (a) is slow, and (b) does not properly handle unicode.  This fixed
    some strange bugs, e.g. in parsing S-cedilla, and improved performance.

    + Replaced 'gsub' with a general list function  'substitute'
      that does not rely on Text.Regex.
    + Rewrote extractTagType in HTML reader so that it doesn't use
      regexs.
    + In Markdown reader, replaced email regex test with a custom email
      autolink parser (autoLinkEmail). Also replaced selfClosingTag regex
      with a custom function isSelfClosingTag.
    + Modified Docbook writer so that it doesn't rely on Text.Regex for
      detecting 'mailto' links.
    + Removed escapePreservingRegex and reamped entity-handling
      functions in Text.Pandoc.Shared and Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences to
      avoid reliance on Text.Regex (see below on character reference
      handling changes).

  * Renamed Text.Pandoc.Entities as Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences.

  * Changed handling of XML entities.  Entities are now parsed (and unicode
    characters returned) in the Markdown and HTML readers, rather than being
    handled in the writers.  In HTML and Docbook writers, UTF-8 is now used
    instead of entities for characters above 128.  This makes the HTML and
    DocBook output much more readable and more easily editable.

    + Removed sgmlHexEntity, sgmlDecimalEntity, sgmlNamedEntity, and
      sgmlCharacterEntity regexes from Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Renamed escapeSGMLChar to escapeCharForXML.  Added escapeStringForXML.
      Moved both functions to Text.Pandoc.Writers.Docbook.
    + Added characterReference parser to Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences.
      This parses a string and return a unicode character.
    + Rewrote decodeCharacterReferences to use the new parser instead of
      Text.Regex.
    + Added new charRef parser for Markdown and HTML, which replaces the
      old 'entity' parser. Added '&' as a special character in Markdown reader.
    + Modified HTML and Markdown readers to call decodeEntities on all raw
      strings (e.g. authors, dates, link titles), to ensure that no
      unprocessed entities are included in the native representation of
      the document.  (In the HTML reader, most of this work is done by a
      change in extractAttributeName.)
    + In XML and Markdown output, escape unicode nonbreaking space as '&nbsp;',
      since a unicode non-breaking space is impossible to distinguish visually
      from a regular space.  (Resolves Issue #3.)
    + Removed encodeEntitiesNumerical.
    + Use Data.Map for entityTable and (new) reverseEntityTable, for a
      slight performance boost over the old association list.
    + Removed unneeded decodeEntities from 'str' parser in HTML and
      Markdown readers.

  * Text.Pandoc.UTF8:  Renamed encodeUTF8 to toUTF8, decodeUTF8 to
    fromUTF8, for clarity.

  * Replaced old haskell98 module names replaced by hierarchical module
    names, e.g. List by Data.List.  Removed haskell98 from dependencies
    in pandoc.cabal, and added mtl (needed for state monad). Substituted
    xhtml for html.

  * Refactored and cleaned up character escaping in writers, using
    backslashEscapes and escapeStringUsing functions.

  * Instead of adding "\n\n" to the end of an input string in Main.hs,
    this is now done in the readers. This makes the libraries behave
    the way you'd expect from the pandoc program. Resolves Issue #10.

  * URLs and email addresses in autolinks are now typeset as Code.

  * In Main.hs, changed putStr to putStrLn -- mainly because MacOS X
    doesn't display the whole output unless there's a line ending.

  * Major code cleanup in all modules, for greater consistency, concision,
    and readability.

  * HTML reader:

    + Fixed several bugs (extractTagType, attribute parsing).
    + Remove Null blocks in lists of blocks when possible.
    + Allow HTML comments as raw HTML inline.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Ordered list items may no longer begin with uppercase letters, or
      letters greater than 'n'.  (This prevents first initials and page
      reference, e.g. 'p. 400', from being parsed as beginning lists.)
      Also, numbers beginning list items may no longer end with ')',
      which is now allowed only after letters.  Note: These changes
      may cause documents to be parsed differently. Users should take
      care in upgrading.
    + Changed autoLink parsing to conform better to Markdown.pl's
      behavior. `<google.com>` is not treated as a link, but
      `<http://google.com>`, `<ftp://google.com>`, and
      `<mailto:google@google.com>` are.
    + Cleaned up handling of embedded quotes in link titles.  Now these are
      stored as a '"' character, not as '&quot;'.
    + Use lookAhead parser for the 'first pass' (looking for reference keys),
      instead of parsing normally, then using setInput to reset input.  This
      yields a slight performance boost.
    + Fixed several bugs in smart quote recognition.
    + Fixed bug in indentSpaces (which didn't properly handle
      cases with mixed spaces and tabs).
    + Consolidated 'text', 'special', and 'inline' into 'inline'.
    + Fixed bug which allowed URL and title to be separated by multiple blank
      lines in links and reference keys.  They can be on separate lines but
      can't have blank lines between them.
    + Correctly handle bracketed text inside inline footnotes and links,using
      new function inlinesInBalanced.  Resolves Issue #14.
    + Fixed bug in footnotes: links in footnotes were not being
      processed. Solution: three-stage parse. First, get all the
      reference keys and add information to state. Next, get all the
      notes and add information to state. (Reference keys may be needed
      at this stage.) Finally, parse everything else.
    + Replaced named constants like 'emphStart' with literals.
    + Removed an extra occurance of escapedChar in definition of inline.

  * RST reader:

    + Allow the URI in a RST hyperlink target to start on the line
      after the reference key.
    + Added 'try' in front of 'string', where needed, or used a different
      parser.  This fixes a bug where ````` would not be correctly parsed as
      a verbatim `.
    + Fixed slow performance in parsing inline literals in RST reader.  The
      problem was that ``#`` was seen by 'inline' as a potential link or image.
      Fix:  inserted 'notFollowedBy (char '`')' in link parsers.
      Resolves Issue #8.
    + Use lookAhead instead of getInput/setInput in RST reader.  Removed
      unneeded getState call, since lookAhead automatically saves and
      restores the parser state.
    + Allow hyperlink target URIs to be split over multiple lines, and
      to start on the line after the reference. Resolves Issue #7.
    + Fixed handling of autolinks.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Replaced 'choice [(try (string ...), ...]' idiom with 'oneOfStrings',
      for clarity.
    + Added clauses for tilde and caret. Tilde is \ensuremath{\sim}, and
      caret is \^{}, not \^ as before.
    + Added parsing for \url.
    + Parse \texttt{} as code, provided there's nothing fancy inside.

  * HTML writer:

    + Modified HTML writer to use the Text.XHtml library. This results
      in cleaner, faster code, and it makes it easier to use Pandoc in
      other projects, like wikis, which use Text.XHtml. Two functions are
      now provided, writeHtml and writeHtmlString: the former outputs an
      Html structure, the latter a rendered string. The S5 writer is also
      changed, in parallel ways (writeS5, writeS5String).
    + The Html header is now written programmatically, so it has been
      removed from the 'headers' directory. The S5 header is still
      needed, but the doctype and some of the meta declarations have
      been removed, since they are written programatically. This change
      introduces a new dependency on the xhtml package.
    + Fixed two bugs in email obfuscation involving improper escaping
      of '&' in the `<noscript>` section and in `--strict` mode. Resolves
      Issue #9.
    + Fixed another bug in email obfuscation: If the text to be obfuscated
      contains an entity, this needs to be decoded before obfuscation.
      Thanks to thsutton for the patch. Resolves Issue #15.
    + Changed the way the backlink is displayed in HTML footnotes.
      Instead of appearing on a line by itself, it now generally
      appears on the last line of the note.  (Exception:  when the
      note does not end with a Plain or Para block.) This saves space
      and looks better.
    + Added automatic unique identifiers to headers:
      - The identifier is derived from the header via a scheme
        documented in README.
      - WriterState now includes a list of header identifiers and a table
        of contents in addition to notes.
      - The function uniqueIdentifiers creates a list of unique identifiers
        from a list of inline lists (e.g. headers).
      - This list is part of WriterState and gets consumed by blockToHtml
        each time a header is encountered.
    + Include CSS for .strikethrough class in header only if strikethrough
      text appears in the document.
    + If the 'strict' option is specified, elements that do not appear in
      standard markdown (like definition lists) are passed through as
      raw HTML.
    + Simplified treatment of autolinks, using pattern matching instead of
      conditionals.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Links in markdown output are now printed as inline links by default,
      rather than reference links.  A --reference-links option has been added
      that forces links to be printed as reference links.  Resolves Issue #4.
    + Use autolinks when possible.  Instead of `[site.com](site.com)`,
      use `<site.com>`.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Rewrote to use the State monad. The preamble now includes only those
      packages that are actually required, given the document's content.
      Thus, for example, if strikeout is not used, ulem is not required.
      Modified LaTeXHeader accordingly.
    + Modified LaTeX writer to insert '\,' between consecutive quotes.
    + Removed unused function tableRowColumnWidths.
    + Simplified code for escaping special characters.
    + Leave extra blank line after \maketitle.
    + Include empty '\author{}' when no author specified to avoid LaTeX
      errors.
    + Include fancyvrb code in header only if needed -- that is, only
      if there is actually code in a footnote.
    + Use \url{} for autolinks.
    + Include [mathletters] option in ucs package, so that basic unicode
      Greek letters will work correctly.

  * RST writer:  Force blank line before lists, so that sublists will
    be handled correctly.

  * Docbook writer:  Fixed a bug:  email links with text, like
    [foo](me@bar.baz), were being incorrectly treated as autolinks.

  * Removed Text.ParserCombinators.Pandoc and moved all its functions to
    Text.Pandoc.Shared.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:

    + Added defaultWriterOptions.
    + Added writerTableOfContents to WriterOptions.
    + Added writerIgnoreNotes option to WriterOptions.  This is needed
      for processing header blocks for a table of contents, since notes on
      headers should not appear in the TOC.
    + Added prettyprinting for native Table format.
    + Removed some unneeded imports.
    + Moved escape and nullBlock parsers from
      Text.ParserCombinators.Pandoc, since the latter is for
      general-purpose parsers that don't depend on Text.Pandoc.Definition.
    + Moved isHeaderBlock from Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML.
    + Moved Element, headerAtLeast, and hierarchicalize from Docbook
      writer, because HTML writer now uses these in constructing a table
      of contents.
    + Added clauses for new inline elements (Strikeout, Superscript,
      Subscript) to refsMatch.
    + Removed backslashEscape; added new functions escapeStringUsing and
      backslashEscapes.
    + Moved failIfStrict from markdown reader, since it is now used also
      by the HTML reader.
    + Added a 'try' to the definition of indentSpaces.
    + In definition of 'reference', added check to make sure it's not a note
      reference.
    + Added functions: camelCaseToHyphenated, toRomanNumeral,
      anyOrderedListMarker, orderedListmarker, orderedListMarkers,
      charsInBalanced', withHorizDisplacement, romanNumeral
    + Fixed a bug in the anyLine parser. Previously it would parse an empty
      string "", but it should fail on an empty string, or we get an error
      when it is used inside "many" combinators.
    + Removed followedBy' parser, replacing it with the lookAhead parser from
      Parsec.
    + Added some needed 'try's before multicharacter parsers, especially in
      'option' contexts.
    + Removed the 'try' from the 'end' parser in 'enclosed', so that
      'enclosed' behaves like 'option', 'manyTill', etc.
    + Added lineClump parser, which parses a raw line block up to and
      including any following blank lines.
    + Renamed parseFromStr to parseFromString.
    + Added a 'try' to the 'end' parser in 'enclosed'.  This makes errors in
      the use of 'enclosed' less likely. Removed some now-unnecessary 'try's
      in calling code.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' in blanklines.
    + Removed endsWith function and rewrote calling functions to use
      isSuffixOf instead.
    + Added >>~ combinator.
    + Fixed bug in normalizeSpaces:  Space:Str "":Space should compress to
      Space.

  * Refactored runtests.pl; added separate tests for tables.

  * Shell scripts:

    + Added -asxhtml flag to tidy in html2markdown. This will
      perhaps help the parser, which expects closing tags.
    + Modified markdown2pdf to run pdflatex a second time if --toc or
      --table-of-contents was specified; otherwise the table of
      contents won't appear.
    + Modified markdown2pdf to print a helpful message if the 'ulem'
      LaTeX package is required and not found.

  * Changes to build process:

    + Dropped support for compilation with GHC 6.4.  GHC 6.6 or higher
      is now required.
    + Removed cabalize and Pandoc.cabal.in. The repository now contains
      pandoc.cabal itself.
    + Pandoc.cabal has been changed to pandoc.cabal, because HackageDB
      likes the cabal file to have the same name as the tarball.
    + Expanded and revised the package description in pandoc.cabal.
      Revised the package synopsis.
    + The tarball built by 'make tarball' now contains files built from
      templates (including man pages and shell scripts), so pandoc can
      be built directly using Cabal tools, without preprocessing.
    + Executable binaries are now stripped before installing.
    + Man pages are now generated from markdown sources, using pandoc's
      man page writer.
    + Use HTML version of README (instead of RTF) in Mac OS X installer.
    + Instead of testing for the existence of a pandoc symlink in build-exec,
      use ln -f.

  * Documentation:

    + Updated README and man pages with information on new features.
    + Updated INSTALL instructions with some useful clarifications and
      links.
    + Updated web content.

  * Added FreeBSD port.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * debian/control:

    + Changed pandoc's Build-Depends to include libghc6-mtl-dev and
      libghc6-xhtml-dev.  Removed libghc6-html-dev.
    + Suggest texlive-latex-recommended | tetex-extra instead of
      tetex-bin.  This brings in fancyvrb and unicode support.

pandoc (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Changes in pandoc options:

    + Allow options to follow or precede arguments.
    + Changed '--smartypants' to '--smart' and adjusted symbols accordingly.
    + Added '--strict' option.
    + Added '-o/--output' option.
    + Added '--dump-args' and '--ignore-args' options (for use in wrappers).
    + Modified '-v' and '-h' output to go to STDERR, not STDOUT, and return
      error conditions.  This is helpful for writing wrappers.
    + Added copyright message to '-v' output, modeled after FSF messages.
    + Reformatted usage message so that it doesn't wrap illegibly.
    + Removed extra blanks after '-h' and '-D' output.

  * Added docbook writer.

  * Added implicit setting of default input and output format based
    on input and output filename extensions.  These defaults are
    overridden if explicit input and output formats are specified using
    '-t', '-f', '-r', or '-w' options.  Documented in pandoc(1) man page
    and README.

  * Allow ordered list items to begin with (single) letters, as well
    as numbers.  The list item marker may now be terminated either by
    '.' or by ')'.  This extension to standard markdown is documented
    in README.

  * Revised footnote syntax.  (See README for full details.)  The
    '[^1]' format now standard in markdown extensions is supported,
    as are inline footnotes with this syntax: '^[My note.]'.
    The earlier footnote syntax '^(1)' is no longer supported.

  * Improved HTML representation of footnotes.  All footnotes
    are now auto-numbered and appear in an ordered list at the
    end of the HTML document.  Since the default appearance is now
    acceptable, the old footnote styles have been removed from the
    HTML header.

  * Bug fixes:

    + Fixed a serious bug in the markdown, LaTeX, and RST readers.
      These readers ran 'runParser' on processed chunks of text to handle
      embedded block lists in lists and quotation blocks.  But then
      any changes made to the parser state in these chunks was lost,
      as the state is local to the parser.  So, for example, footnotes
      didn't work in quotes or list items.  The fix:  instead of calling
      runParser on some raw text, use setInput to make it the input, then
      parse it, then use setInput to restore the input to what it was
      before.  This is shorter and more elegant, and it fixes the problem.
    + Fixed bug in notFollowedBy' combinator (adding 'try' before
      'parser').  Adjusted code that uses this combinator accordingly.
    + Fixed bug in RTF writer that caused improper indentation on
      footnotes occurring in indented blocks like lists.
    + Fixed parsing of metadata in LaTeX reader.  Now the title, author,
      and date are parsed correctly.  Everything else in the preamble
      is skipped.
    + Modified escapedChar in LaTeX reader to allow a '\' at the end of a
      line to count as escaped whitespace.
    + Modified LaTeX reader to produce inline links rather than reference
      links.  Otherwise, links in footnotes aren't handled properly.
    + Fixed handling of titles in links in Markdown reader, so that
      embedded quotation marks are now handled properly.
    + Fixed Markdown reader's handling of embedded brackets in links.
    + Fixed Markdown reader so that it only parses bracketed material
      as a reference link if there is actually a corresponding key.
    + Revised inline code parsing in Markdown reader to conform to
      markdown standard.  Now any number of `s can begin inline code,
      which will end with the same number of `s.  For example, to
      have two backticks as code, write ``` `` ```.  Modified Markdown
      writer accordingly.
    + Fixed bug in text-wrapping routine in Markdown and RST writers.
      Now LineBreaks no longer cause wrapping problems.
    + Supported hexadecimal numerical entity references as well as
      decimal ones.
    + Fixed bug in Markdown reader's handling of underscores and other
      inline formatting markers inside reference labels:  for example,
      in '[A_B]: /url/a_b', the material between underscores was being
      parsed as emphasized inlines.
    + Changed Markdown reader's handling of backslash escapes so that
      only non-alphanumeric characters can be escaped.  Strict mode
      follows Markdown.pl in only allowing a select group of punctuation
      characters to be escaped.
    + Modified HTML reader to skip a newline following a `<br>` tag.
      Otherwise the newline will be treated as a space at the beginning
      of the next line.

  * Made handling of code blocks more consistent.  Previously, some
    readers allowed trailing newlines, while others stripped them.
    Now, all readers strip trailing newlines in code blocks. Writers
    insert a newline at the end of code blocks as needed.

  * Modified readers to make spacing at the end of output more consistent.

  * Minor improvements to LaTeX reader:

    + '\thanks' now treated like a footnote.
    + Simplified parsing of LaTeX command arguments and options.
      commandArgs now returns a list of arguments OR options (in
      whatever order they appear).  The brackets are included, and
      a new stripFirstAndLast function is provided to strip them off
      when needed.  This fixes a problem in dealing with \newcommand
      and \newenvironment.

  * Revised RTF writer:

    + Default font is now Helvetica.
    + An '\f0' is added to each '\pard', so that font resizing works
      correctly.

  * Moved handling of "smart typography" from the writers to the Markdown
    and LaTeX readers.  This allows great simplification of the writers
    and more accurate smart quotes, dashes, and ellipses.  DocBook can
    now use `<quote>`.  The '--smart' option now toggles an option in
    the parser state rather than a writer option.  Several new kinds
    of inline elements have been added: Quoted, Ellipses, Apostrophe,
    EmDash, EnDash.

  * Changes in HTML writer:

    + Include title block in header even when title is null.
    + Made javascript obfuscation of emails even more obfuscatory,
      by combining it with entity obfuscation.

  * Changed default ASCIIMathML text color to black.

  * Test suite:

    + Added --strip-trailing-cr option to diff in runtests.pl, for
      compatibility with Windows.
    + Added regression tests with footnotes in quote blocks and lists.

  * Makefile changes:

    + osx-pkg target creates a Mac OS X package (directory). New osx
      directory contains files needed for construction of the package.
    + osx-dmg target creates a compressed disk image containing the package.
    + win-pkg target creates Windows binary package.
    + tarball target creates distribution source tarball.
    + website target generates pandoc's website automatically, including
      demos.  New 'web' directory containts files needed for construction
      of the website (which will be created as the 'pandoc' subdirectory
      of 'web').
    + Makefile checks to see if we're running Windows/Cygwin; if so,
      a '.exe' extension is added to each executable in EXECS.

  * Removed all wrappers except markdown2pdf and html2markdown.

  * Added new wrapper hsmarkdown, to be used as a drop-in replacement
    for Markdown.pl.  hsmarkdown calls pandoc with the '--strict'
    option and disables other options.

  * Added code to html2markdown that tries to determine the character
    encoding of an HTML file, by parsing the "Content-type" meta tag.

    + If the encoding can't be determined, then if the content is local,
      the local encoding is used; if it comes from a URL, UTF-8 is used
      by default.
    + If input is from STDIN, don't try to determine character encoding.
    + Encoding can be specified explicitly using '-e' option.

  * Improved warning messages in wrappers:

    + Print warning if iconv not available
    + More user-friendly error messages in markdown2pdf, when
      pdflatex fails.

  * Code cleanup:

    + Renamed 'Text/Pandoc/HtmlEntities' module to
      'Text/Pandoc/Entities'. Also changed function names so as
      not to be HTML-specific.
    + Refactored SGML string escaping functions from HTML and Docbook
      writers into Text/Pandoc/Shared.  (escapeSGML, stringToSGML)
    + Removed 'BlockQuoteContext' from ParserContext, as it isn't
      used anywhere.
    + Removed splitBySpace and replaced it with a general, polymorphic
      splitBy function.
    + Refactored LaTeX reader for clarity (added isArg function).
    + Converted some CR's to LF's in src/ui/default/print.css.
    + Added license text to top of source files.
    + Added module data for haddock to source files.
    + Reformatted code for consistency.

  * Rewrote documentation and man pages.  Split README into INSTALL
    and README.

  * Split LICENSE into COPYING and COPYRIGHT.

  * Removed TODO, since we now maintain ToDo on the wiki.

  * Made COPYRIGHT in top level a symlink to debian/copyright, to avoid
    duplication.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Revamped build process to conform to debian standards and created
    a proper debian package.  Closes: #391666.

  * Modified build process to support GHC 6.6.

    + The package can still be compiled using GHC 6.4.2, though because
      of dependencies the "make deb" target works only with GHC 6.6+.
    + The script 'cabalize' is used to create an appropriate
      'Pandoc.cabal' from 'Pandoc.cabal.in', depending on the GHC and
      Cabal versions.

  * Refactored template processing (fillTemplates.pl).

  * Modified wrapper scripts to make them more robust and portable.
    To avoid code duplication and ensure consistency, wrappers are
    generated via a templating system from templates in src/wrappers.

    + Wrappers now accept multiple filenames, when appropriate.
    + Spaces and tabs allowed in filenames.
    + getopts shell builtin is used for portable option parsing.
    + Improved html2markdown's web grabber code, making it more robust,
      configurable and verbose.  Added '-e', '-g' options.
