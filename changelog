pandoc (1.8.2)

  * Added script to produce OS X package.

  * Made `templates` directory a git submodule.  This should make it
    easier for people to revise their custom templates when the default
    templates change.

  * Changed template naming scheme: `FORMAT.template` -> `default.FORMAT`.
    **Note:** If you have existing templates in `~/.pandoc/templates`, you
    must rename them to conform to the new scheme!

  * Fixed smart quotes bug, now handling `'...hi'` properly.

  * RST reader:

    + Partial support for labeled footnotes.
    + Improved accuracy of `simpleReferenceName` parser.

  * HTML reader:

    + Substitute correct unicode characters for
      characters in the 128..159 range, which are often found even in
      HTML that purports to be UTF-8.

  * LaTeX reader:  Handle `\subtitle` command (a subtitle is added
    to the title, after a colon and linebreak). Closes #280.

  * Leaner `reference.odt`.

  * Added unexported module `Text.Pandoc.MIME` for use in
    the ODT writer.

  * ODT writer:  Construct `manifest.xml` based on archive contents.
    This fixes a bug in ODTs containing images. Recent versions of
    LibreOffice would reject these as corrupt, because `manifest.xml`
    did not contain a reference to the image files.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Make verbatim environments flush to avoid spurious
      blank lines.  Closes #277.
    + Use `\texttt` and escapes insntead of `\verb!...!`, which
      is too fragile (doesn't work in command arguments).
    + Use `\enquote{}` for quotes if the template includes
      the `csquotes` package. This provides better support for
      local quoting styles. (Thanks to Andreas Wagner for the idea.)

  * ConTeXt writer:  Make `\starttyping`/`\stoptyping` flush with
    margin, preventing spurious blank lines.

  * Slidy writer:

    + Use non-minimized version of `slidy.css` with `--offline`
      option, so users can more easily edit it.
    + Also fixed a bug in the CSS that prevented proper centering
      of title (now reported and fixed upstream).

  * S5 writer:

    + Replaced `s5/default/slides.js.{comment,packed}` with
      new compressed `s5/default/slides.min.js`.
    + Use `data:` protocol to embed S5 CSS in `<link>` tags,
      when `--offline` is specified. Using inline CSS didn't
      work with Chrome or Safari.  This fixes offline
      S5 on those browsers.

  * HTML writer:  Removed English title on footnote backlinks.
    This is incongrous in non-English documents.

  * Docbook writer:

    + Use CALS tables.  (Some older docbook software does not work
      well with XHTML tables.)  Closes #77.
    + Use `programlisting` tags (instead of `screen`) for code blocks.

  * `markdown2pdf`:

    + Calls latex with `-halt-on-error -interaction nonstopmode` instead
      of `-interaction=batchmode`, which essentially just ignored errors,
      leading to bad results. Better to know when something is wrong.
    + Fixed issues with non-UTF-8 output of `pdflatex`.
    + Better error reporting.

  * `--mathjax` now takes an optional URL argument. If it is not
    provided, pandoc links directly to the (secure) mathjax CDN,
    as now recommended (thanks to dsanson).

  * Deprecated `--xetex` option in `pandoc`.  It is no longer needed,
    since the LaTeX writer now produces a file that can be processed by
    `latex`, `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, or `xelatex`.

  * Introduced `--luatex` option to `markdown2pdf`. This causes `lualatex`
    to be used to create the PDF.

  * If a template specified with `--template` is not found, look for it
    in `datadir`.  Also, if no extension is provided, supply one based
    on the writer.  So now you can put your `special.latex` template in
    `~/.pandoc/templates`, and use it from any directory via
    `pandoc -t latex --template special`.

  * Default template improvements:

    + HTML:  Display author and date after title.
    + HTML:  Made table of contents more customizable.  The container
      for the TOC is now in the template, so users can insert a header
      or other styling. (Thanks to Bruce D'Arcus for the suggestion.)
    + HTML, Slidy, S5:  Enclose scripts in CDATA tags.
    + Slidy, S5: Added `s5-url` and `slidy-url` variables, instead of
      hard-coding.  If you want to put your slidy files in the slidy
      subdirectory, for example, you can do
      `pandoc -t slidy -V slidy-url=slidy -s`.
    + LaTeX: Use `\and` to separate authors in LaTeX documents (reader
      & writer).  Closes #279.
    + LaTeX: Use different `hyperref` options for `xetex`, fixing
      problems with unicode bookmarks (thanks to CircleCode).
    + LaTeX: Removed `ucs` package, use `utf8` rather than `utf8x`
      with `inputenc`.  This covers fewer characters but is more
      robust with other packages, and `ucs` is unmaintained.  Users
      who need better unicode support should use xelatex or lualatex.

pandoc (1.8.1.2)

  * Added `--epub-cover-image` option.

  * Documented `--biblatex` and `--natbib` options.

  * Allow `--section-divs` with slidy output.  Resolves Issue #296.

  * Disallow notes within notes in reST and markdown.
    These previously caused infinite looping and stack overflows.
    For example:

        [^1]

        [^1]: See [^1]

    Note references are allowed in reST notes, so this isn't a full
    implementation of reST. That can come later. For now we need to
    prevent the stack overflows.  Partially resolves Issue #297.

  * EPUB writer: Allow non-plain math methods.

  * Forbid ()s in citation item keys.  Resolves Issue #304: problems with
    `(@item1; @item2)` because the final paren was being parsed as part of
    the item key.

  * Changed URI parser so it doesn't include trailing punctuation.
    So, in RST, `http://google.com.` should be parsed as a link followed by a
    period. The parser is smart enough to recognize balanced parentheses, as
    often occur in wikipedia links: `http://foo.bar/baz_(bam)`.

  * Markdown+lhs reader: Require space after inverse bird tracks, so that
    HTML tags can be used freely at the left margin of a markdown+lhs document.
    Thanks to Conal Elliot for the suggestion.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Improved emph/strong parsing; fixes bug found by Perry Wagle.
    + Fixed bug in footnote order (reported by CircleCode).

  * RST reader:
      + Fixed bug in in field lists with multi-line items at the
        end of the list.
      + Added parentheses to RST `specialChars`, so
        `(http://google.com)` will be parsed as a link in parens.
        Resolves Issue #291.
      + Allow `|` followed by newline in RST line block.

  * LaTeX reader:
      + Support `\dots`.
      + Gobble option & space after linebreak `\\[10pt]`.

  * Textile reader:
      + Make it possible to have colons after links.  (qerub)
      + Make it possible to have colons after links.  (Christoffer Sawicki)

  * HTML reader:
      + Skip spaces after `<b>`, `<emph>`, etc.
      + Handle tbody, thead in simple tables.  Closes #274.
      + Implicit `Para`s instead of `Plains` in some contexts.

  * OpenDocument writer:  Use special `First paragraph` style for
    first paragraph after most non-paragraph blocks. This allows users to
    specify e.g. that only paragraphs after the first paragraph of a block are
    to be indented. Thanks to Andrea Rossato for the patch. Closes #20.

  * LaTeX writer:  use `deVerb` on table and picture captions.
    Otherwise LaTeX complains about `\verb` inside command argument.
    Thanks to bbanier for reporting the bug.

  * Markdown writer: Insert HTML comment btw list and indented code block.
    This prevents the code block from being interpreted as part of the list.

  * EPUB writer: Add a meta element specify the cover.
    Some EPUB e-readers, such as the Nook, require a meta element inside the
    OPF metadata block to ensure the cover image is properly displayed.
    (Kelsey Hightower)

  * HTML writer: Use embed tag for images with non-image extensions.
    (e.g.  PDFs).  Closes #264.

  * LaTeX writer: Improved tables.

      + More space between lines, top-align cells.
      + Use ctable package, which allows footnotes and
        provides additional options.
      + Made cell alignments work in multiline tables.
      + Closes #271, #272.

  * Un-URI-escape image filenames in LaTeX, ConTeXt, RTF, Texinfo.
    Also do this when copying image files into EPUBs and ODTs.
    Closes #263.

  * Changed to github issue tracker.

  * Added failing emph/strong markdown test case due to Perry Wagle.

  * Slidy improvements:
      + Updated to use Slidy2.
      + Fixed bug, unclosed div tag.
      + Added `duration` variable in template.
        Setting this activates the timer.
      + Use 'titlepage' instead of 'cover' for title div.

pandoc (1.8.1.1)

  * `markdown2pdf`:  Removed some debugging lines accidentally included
    in the 1.8.1 release. With those lines, the temp directory is created
    in the working directory, and it is not deleted.  This fix restores
    the original behavior.

pandoc (1.8.1)

  * Added `--ascii` option.  Currently supported only in HTML writer,
    which it causes to use numerical entities instead of UTF-8.

  * EPUB writer: `--toc` now works to provide a table of contents
    at the beginning of each chapter.

  * LaTeX writer:  Change figure defaults to `htbp`.
    This prevents "too many unprocessed floats."  Resolves
    Issue #285.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8`:  Encode filenames even when using recent
    base.

  * `markdown2pdf`: Fixed filename encoding issues. With help from Paulo
    Tanimoto. Resolves Issue #286.

  * HTML writer: Put line breaks in section divs.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`: Make `writerSectionDivs` default to False.

pandoc (1.8.0.3)

  * Fixed Source-repository stanza in cabal file.

pandoc (1.8.0.2)

  * HTML writer:

    + Stringify alt text instead of converting to HTML.
    + Break lines after block elements, not inside tags.
      HTML output now closely resembles that of tidy. Resolves Issue #134.

  * Markdown reader: Fixed bug in footnote block parser (pointed out
    by Jesse Rosenthal).  The problem arose when the blank line
    at the end of a footnote block contained indenting spaces.

  * Shared: Improved 'normalize' function so it normalizes Spaces too.
    In normal form, Space elements only occur to separate two non-Space
    elements.  So, we never have [Space], or [, ..., Space].

  * Tests:

    + Improved Arbitrary instance.
    + Added timeout for test instances.

  * README:

    + Added section on four-space rule for lists.  Resolves Issue #283.
    + Clarified optional arguments on math options.

  * markdown2pdf: Fixed bug with output file extensions.
    Previously `markdown2pdf test.txt -o test.en.pdf` would produce
    `test.pdf`, not `test.en.pdf`.  Thanks to Paolo Tanimoto for the fix.

pandoc (1.8.0.1)

  * Revised Interact.hs so that it works with the CPP macros
    in the UTF8 module.

  * Revised Setup.hs so that we don't call MakeManPage.hs unless
    the man pages are out of date.

pandoc (1.8)

  [new features]

  * Support for citations using Andrea Rossato's `citeproc-hs` 0.3.
    You can now write, for example,

        Water is wet [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

    and, when you process your document using `pandoc`, specifying
    a citation style using `--csl` and a bibliography using `--bibliography`,
    the citation will be replaced by an appropriately formatted
    citation, and a list of works cited will be added to the end
    of the document.

    This means that you can switch effortlessly between different citation
    and bibliography styles, including footnote, numerical, and author-date
    formats. The bibliography can be in any of the following formats: MODS,
    BibTeX, BibLaTeX, RIS, EndNote, EndNote XML, ISI, MEDLINE, Copac, or JSON.
    See the README for further details.

    Citations are supported in the markdown reader, using a special
    syntax, and in the LaTeX reader, using natbib or biblatex syntax.
    (Thanks to Nathan Gass for the natbib and biblatex support.)

  * New `textile` reader and writer.  Thanks to Paul Rivier for contributing
    the `textile` reader, an almost complete implementation of the textile
    syntax used by the ruby [RedCloth library](http://redcloth.org/textile).
    Resolves Issue #51.

  * New `org` writer, for Emacs Org-mode, contributed by Puneeth Chaganti.

  * New `json` reader and writer, for reading and writing a JSON
    representation of the native Pandoc AST.  These are much faster
    than the `native` reader and writer, and should be used for
    serializing Pandoc to text.  To convert between the JSON representation
    and native Pandoc, use `encodeJSON` and `decodeJSON` from
    `Text.JSON.Generic`.

  * A new `jsonFilter` function in `Text.Pandoc` makes it easy
    to write scripts that transform a JSON-encoded pandoc document.
    For example:

        -- removelinks.hs - removes links from document
        import Text.Pandoc
        main = interact $ jsonFilter $ bottomUp removeLink
                 where removeLink (Link xs _) = Emph xs
                       removeLink x = x

    To use this to remove links while translating markdown to LaTeX:

        pandoc -t json | runghc removelinks.hs | pandoc -f json -t latex

  * Attributes are now allowed in inline `Code` elements, for example:

        In this code, `ulist ! [theclass "special"] << elts`{.haskell} is...

    The attribute syntax is the same as for delimited code blocks.
    `Code` inline has an extra argument place for attributes, just like
    `CodeBlock`. Inline code will be highlighted in HTML output, if pandoc
    is compiled with highlighting support. Resolves Issue #119.

  * New `RawBlock` and `RawInline` elements (replacing `RawHtml`,
    `HtmlInline`, and `TeX`) provide lots of flexibility in writing
    scripts to transform Pandoc documents. Scripts can now change
    how each element is rendered in each output format.

  * You can now define LaTeX macros in markdown documents, and pandoc
    will apply them to TeX math.  For example,

        \newcommand{\plus}[2]{#1 + #2}
        $\plus{3}{4}$

    yields `3+4`.  Since the macros are applied in the reader, they
    will work in every output format, not just LaTeX.

  * LaTeX macros can also be used in LaTeX documents (both in math
    and in non-math contexts).

  * A new `--mathjax` option has been added for displaying
    math in HTML using MathJax.  Resolves issue #259.

  * Footnotes are now supported in the RST reader. (Note, however,
    that unlike docutils, pandoc ignores the numeral or symbol used in
    the note; footnotes are put in an auto-numbered ordered list.)
    Resolves Issue #258.

  * A new `--normalize` option causes pandoc to normalize the AST
    before writing the document.  This means that, for example,
    `*hi**there*` will be rendered as `<em>hithere</em>`
    instead of `<em>hi</em><em>there</em>`.  This is not the default,
    because there is a significant performance penalty.

  * A new `--chapters` command-line option causes headers
    in DocBook, LaTeX, and ConTeXt to start with "chapter" (level one).
    Resolves Issue #265.

  * In DocBook output, `<chapter>` is now used for top-level
    headers if the template contains `<book>`. Resolves Issue #265.

  * A new `--listings` option in `pandoc` and `markdown2pdf` causes
    the LaTeX writer to use the listings package for code blocks.
    (Thanks to Josef Svennigsson for the pandoc patch, and Etienne
    Millon for the markdown2pdf patch.)

  * `markdown2pdf` now supports `--data-dir`.

  * URLs in autolinks now have class "url" so they can be styled.

  * Improved prettyprinting in most formats.  Lines will be wrapped
    more evenly and duplicate blank lines avoided.

  * New `--columns` command-line option sets the column width for
    line wrapping and relative width calculations for tables.

  * Made `--smart` work in HTML, RST, and Textile readers, as well
    as markdown.

  * Added `--html5` option for HTML5 output.

  * Added support for listings package in LaTeX reader
    (Puneeth Chaganti).

  * Added support for simple tables in the LaTeX reader.

  * Added support for simple tables in the HTML reader.

  * Significant performance improvements in many readers and writers.

  [API and program changes]

  * Moved `Text.Pandoc.Definition` from the `pandoc` package to a new
    auxiliary package, `pandoc-types`. This will make it possible for other
    programs to supply output in Pandoc format, without depending on the whole
    pandoc package.

  * Added `Attr` field to `Code`.

  * Removed `RawHtml`, `HtmlInline`, and `TeX` elements; added generic
    `RawBlock` and `RawInline`.

  * Moved generic functions to `Text.Pandoc.Generic`. Deprecated
    `processWith`, replacing it with two functions, `bottomUp` and `topDown`.
    Removed previously deprecated functions `processPandoc` and `queryPandoc`.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Builder`, for building `Pandoc` structures.

  * `Text.Pandoc` now exports association lists `readers` and `writers`.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Native`, which exports `readNative`.
    `readNative` can now read full pandoc documents, block lists, blocks,
    inline lists, or inlines.  It will interpret `Str "hi"`
    as if it were `Pandoc (Meta [] [] []) [Plain [Str "hi"]]`.
    This should make testing easier.

  * Removed deprecated `-C/--custom-header` option.
    Use `--template` instead.

  * `--biblio-file` has been replaced by `--bibliography`.
    `--biblio-format` has been removed; pandoc now guesses the format
    from the file extension (see README).

  * pandoc will treat an argument as a URI only if it has an
    `http(s)` scheme.  Previously pandoc would treat some
    Windows pathnames beginning with `C:/` as URIs.

  * The `--sanitize-html` option and the `stateSanitize` field in
    `ParserState` have been removed. Sanitization is better done in the
    resulting HTML using `xss-sanitize`, which is based on pandoc's
    sanitization, but improved.

  * pandoc now adds a newline to the end of its output in fragment
    mode (= not `--standalone`).

  * Added support for `lang` in `html` tag in the HTML template,
    so you can do `pandoc -s -V lang=es`, for example.

  * `highlightHtml` in `Text.Pandoc.Highlighting` now takes
    a boolean argument that selects between "inline" and
    "block" HTML.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Writers.RTF` now exports `rtfEmbedImage`.
    Images are embedded in RTF output when possible (png, jpeg).
    Resolves Issue #275.

  * Added `Text.Pandoc.Pretty`. This is better suited for pandoc than the
    `pretty` package.  Changed all writers that used
    `Text.PrettyPrint.HughesPJ` to use `Text.Pandoc.Pretty` instead.

  * Rewrote `writeNative` using the new prettyprinting module. It is
    now much faster. The output has been made more consistent and compressed.
    `writeNative` is also now sensitive to writerStandalone`, and will simply
    `print a block list if writerStandalone` is False.

  * Removed `Text.Pandoc.Blocks`. `Text.Pandoc.Pretty` allows you to define
    blocks and concatenate them, so a separate module is no longer needed.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Shared`:

    + Added `writerColumns`, `writerChapters`, and `writerHtml5` to
      `WriterOptions`.
    + Added `normalize`.
    + Removed unneeded prettyprinting functions:
      `wrapped`, `wrapIfNeeded`, `wrappedTeX`, `wrapTeXIfNeeded`, `hang'`,
      `BlockWrapper`, `wrappedBlocksToDoc`.
    + Made `splitBy` take a test instead of an element.
    + Added `findDataFile`, refactored `readDataFile`.
    + Added `stringify`. Rewrote `inlineListToIdentifier` using `stringify`.
    + Fixed `inlineListToIdentifier` to treat '\160' as ' '.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML`:

    + Removed `rawHtmlBlock`, `anyHtmlBlockTag`, `anyHtmlInlineTag`,
      `anyHtmlTag`, `anyHtmlEndTag`, `htmlEndTag`, `extractTagType`,
      `htmlBlockElement`, `htmlComment`
    + Added `htmlTag`, `htmlInBalanced`, `isInlineTag`, `isBlockTag`,
      `isTextTag`

  * Moved `smartPunctuation` from `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown`
    to `Text.Pandoc.Readers.Parsing`, and parameterized it with
    an inline parser.

  * Added `nonspaceChar` to `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`.

  * Ellipses are no longer allowed to contain spaces.
    Previously we allowed '. . .', ' . . . ', etc.  This caused
    too many complications, and removed author's flexibility in
    combining ellipses with spaces and periods.

  * Allow linebreaks in URLs (treat as spaces). Also, a string of
    consecutive spaces or tabs is now parsed as a single space. If you have
    multiple spaces in your URL, use `%20%20`.

  * `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`:

    + Removed `refsMatch`.
    + Hid `Key` constructor.
    + Removed custom `Ord` and `Eq` instances for `Key`.
    + Added `toKey` and `fromKey` to convert between `Key` and `[Inline]`.
    + Generalized type on `readWith`.

  * Small change in calculation of relative widths of table columns.
    If the size of the header > the specified column width, use
    the header size as 100% for purposes of calculating
    relative widths of columns.

  * Markdown writer now uses some pandoc-specific features when `--strict`
    is not specified: `\` newline is used for a hard linebreak instead of
    two spaces then a newline. And delimited code blocks are used when
    there are attributes.

  * HTML writer:  improved gladTeX output by setting ENV appropriately
    for display or inline math (Jonathan Daugherty).

  * LaTeX writer: Use `\paragraph`, `\subparagraph` for level 4,5 headers.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + `\label{foo}` and `\ref{foo}` now become `{foo}` instead of `(foo)`.
    + `\index{}` commands are skipped.

  * Added `fontsize` variable to default LaTeX template.
    This makes it easy to set the font size using `markdown2pdf`:
    `markdown2pdf -V fontsize=12pt input.txt`.

  * Fixed problem with strikeout in LaTeX headers when using
    hyperref, by adding a command to the default LaTeX template
    that disables `\sout` inside pdf strings. Thanks to Joost Kremers
    for the fix.

  * The `COLUMNS` environment variable no longer has any effect.

  [under-the-hood improvements]

  * Pandoc now compiles with GHC 7. (This alone leads to a
    significant performance improvement, 15-20%.)

  * Completely rewrote HTML reader using tagsoup as a lexer. The
    new reader is faster and more accurate.  Unlike the
    old reader, it does not get bogged down on some input
    (Issues #277, 255). And it handles namespaces in tags
    (Issue #274).

  * Replaced `escapeStringAsXML` with a faster version.

  * Rewrote `spaceChar` and some other parsers in Text.Pandoc.Parsing
    for a significant performance boost.

  * Improved performance of all readers by rewriting parsers.

  * Simplified Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences by using
    entity lookup functions from TagSoup.

  * `Text.Pandoc.UTF8` now uses the unicode-aware IO functions
    from `System.IO` if base >= 4.2.  This gives support for
    windows line endings on windows.

  * Remove duplications in documentation by generating the
    pandoc man page from README, using `MakeManPage.hs`.

  * README now includes a full description of markdown syntax,
    including non-pandoc-specific parts.  A new `pandoc_markdown`
    man page is extracted from this, so you can look up markdown
    syntax by doing `man pandoc_markdown`.

  * Completely revised test framework (with help from Nathan Gass).
    The new test framework is built when the `tests` Cabal flag is set. It
    includes the old integration tests, but also some new unit and quickcheck
    tests. Test output has been much improved, and you can now specify a glob
    pattern after `cabal test` to indicate which tests should be run;
    for example `cabal test citations` will run all the citation tests.

  * Added a shell script, `stripansi.sh`, for filtering ANSI control
    sequences from test output: `cabal test | ./stripansi.sh > test.log`.

  * Added `Interact.hs` to make it easier to use ghci while developing.
    `Interact.hs` loads `ghci` from the `src` directory, specifying
    all the options needed to load pandoc modules (including
    specific package dependencies, which it gets by parsing
    dist/setup-config).

  * Added `Benchmark.hs`, testing all readers + writers using criterion.

  * Added `stats.sh`, to make it easier to collect and archive
    benchmark and lines-of-code stats.

  * Added upper bounds to all cabal dependencies.

  * Include man pages in extra-source-files.  This allows users to
    install pandoc from the tarball without needing to build the man
    pages.

  [bug fixes]

  * Filenames are encoded as UTF8.  Resolves Issue #252.

  * Handle curly quotes better in `--smart` mode. Previously, curly quotes
    were just parsed literally, leading to problems in some output formats.
    Now they are parsed as `Quoted` inlines, if `--smart` is specified.
    Resolves Issue #270.

  * Text.Pandoc.Parsing: Fixed bug in grid table parser.
    Spaces at end of line were not being stripped properly,
    resulting in unintended LineBreaks.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Allow HTML comments as inline elements in markdown.
      So, `aaa <!-- comment --> bbb` can be a single paragraph.
    + Fixed superscripts with links: `^[link](/foo)^` gets
      recognized as a superscripted link, not an inline note followed by
      garbage.
    + Fixed regression, making markdown reference keys case-insensitive again.
      Resolves Issue #272.
    + Properly handle abbreviations (like `Mr.`) at the end of a line.
    + Better handling of intraword underscores, avoiding exponential
      slowdowns in some cases.  Resolves Issue #182.
    + Fixed bug in alignments in tables with blank rows in the header.

  * RST reader:

    + Field lists now allow spaces in field names, and
      block content in field values. (Thanks to Lachlan Musicman
      for pointing out the bug.)
    + Definition list items are now always `Para` instead of
      `Plain`, matching behavior of `rst2xml.py`.
    + In image blocks, the description is parsed properly and
      used for the alt attribute, not also the title.
    + Skip blank lines at beginning of file. Resolves
      Debian #611328.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Improved parsing of preamble.
      Previously you'd get unexpected behavior on a document that
      contained `\begin{document}` in, say, a verbatim block.
    + Allow spaces between `\begin` or `\end` and `{`.
    + Support `\L` and `\l`.
    + Skip comments inside paragraphs.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Escape strings in `\href{..}`.
    + In nonsimple tables, put cells in `\parbox`.

  * OpenDocument writer:  don't print raw TeX.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Fixed bug in `Image`.  URI was getting unescaped twice!
    + Avoid printing extra blank lines at the end if there are
      no notes or references.

  * LaTeX and ConTeXt: Escape `[` and `]` as `{[}` and `{]}`.
    This avoids unwanted interpretation as an optional argument.

  * ConTeXt writer: Fixed problem with inline code.  Previously
    `}` would be rendered `\type{}}`. Now we check the string for '}' and '{'.
    If it contains neither, use `\type{}`; otherwise use `\mono{}`
    with an escaped version of the string.

  * `:` now allowed in HTML tags. Resolves Issue #274.

pandoc (1.6)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * New EPUB and HTML Slidy writers. (Issue #122)

      - EPUB is a standard ebook format, used in Apple's iBooks for
        the iPad and iPhone, Barnes and Noble's nook reader, the Sony
        reader, and many other devices.
      - Slidy, like S5, is a system for producing HTML+javascript slide
        shows.

  * All input is assumed to be UTF-8, no matter what the locale and ghc
    version, and all output is UTF-8. This reverts to pre-1.5 behavior.
    Also, a BOM, if present, is stripped from the input.

  * Markdown now supports grid tables, whose cells can contain
    arbitrary block elements. (Issue #43)

  * Sequentially numbered example lists in markdown with `@` marker.

  * Markdown table captions can begin with a bare colon and no longer need
    to include the English word "table." Also, a caption can now occur
    either before or after the table. (Issue #227)

  * New command-line options:

      - `--epub-stylesheet` allows you to specify a CSS file that will
        be used to style your ebook.
      - `--epub-metadata` allows you to specify metadata for the ebook.
      - `--offline` causes the generated HTML slideshow to include all
        needed scripts and stylesheets.
      - `--webtex` causes TeX math to be converted to images using the
        Google Charts API (unless a different URL is specified).
      - `--section-divs` causes div tags to be added around each section
        in an HTML document. (Issue #230, 239)

  * Default behavior of S5 writer in standalone mode has changed:
    previously, it would include all needed scripts and stylesheets
    in the generated HTML; now, only links are included unless
    the `--offline` option is used.

  * Default behavior of HTML writer has changed. Between 1.2 and 1.5,
    pandoc would enclose sections in div tags with identifiers on the
    div tags, so that the sections can be manipulated in javascript.
    This caused undesirable interactions with raw HTML div tags. So,
    starting with 1.6, the default is to put the identifiers directly
    on the header tags, and not to include the divs.  The `--section-divs`
    option selects the 1.2-1.5 behavior.

  * API changes:

      - `HTMLMathMethod`: Added `WebTeX`, removed `MimeTeX`.
      - `WriterOptions`: Added `writerUserDataDir`, `writerSourceDirectory`,
        `writerEPUBMetadata` fields. Removed `writerIncludeBefore`,
        `writerIncludeAfter`.
      - Added `headerShift` to `Text.Pandoc.Shared`.
      - Moved parsing code and `ParserState` from `Text.Pandoc.Shared`
        to a new module, `Text.Pandoc.Parsing`.
      - Added `stateHasChapters` to `ParserState`.
      - Added `HTMLSlideVariant`.
      - Made `KeyTable` a map instead of an association list.
      - Added accessors for `Meta` fields (`docTitle`, `docAuthors`,
        `docDate`).
      - `Pandoc`, `Meta`, `Inline`, and `Block` have been given `Ord`
        instances.
      - Reference keys now have a type of their own (`Key`), with its
        own `Ord` instance for case-insensitive comparison.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.EPUB`.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.UUID`.
      - Removed `Text.Pandoc.ODT`, added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.ODT`.
        Removed `saveOpenDocumentAsODT`, added `writeODT`.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.Writers.Native` and `writeNative`.
        Removed `prettyPandoc`.
      - Added `Text.Pandoc.UTF8` for portable UTF8 string IO.
      - Removed `Text.Pandoc.Writers.S5` and the `writeS5` function.
        Moved `s5Includes` to a new module, `Text.Pandoc.S5`.
        To write S5, you now use `writeHtml` with `writerSlideVariant`
        set to `S5Slides` or `SlidySlides`.

  * Template changes.  If you use custom templates, please update them,
    particularly if you use syntax highlighting with pandoc. The old HTML
    templates hardcoded highlighting CSS that will no longer work with
    the most recent version of highlighting-kate.

      - HTML template: avoid empty meta tag if no date.
      - HTML template: Use default highlighting CSS from highlighting-kate
        instead of hard-coding the CSS into the template.
      - HTML template: insert-before text goes before the title, and
        immediately after the <body> tag, as documented. (Issue #241)
      - Added slidy and s5 templates.
      - Added amssymb to preamble of latex template. (github Issue 1)

  * Removed excess newlines at the end of output. Note: because output
    will not contain an extra newline, you may need to make adjustments
    if you are inserting pandoc's output into a template.

  * In S5 and slidy, horizontal rules now cause a new slide, so you
    are no longer limited to one slide per section.

  * Improved handling of code in man writer. Inline code is now monospace,
    not bold, and code blocks now use .nf (no fill) and .IP (indented para).

  * HTML reader parses `<tt>` as Code. (Issue #247)

  * html+lhs output now contains bird tracks, even when compiled without
    highlighting support. (Issue #242)

  * Colons are now no longer allowed in autogenerated XML/HTML identifiers,
    since they have a special meaning in XML.

  * Code improvements in ODT writer.  Remote images are now replaced with
    their alt text rather than a broken link.

  * LaTeX reader improvements:

      - Made latex `\section`, `\chapter` parsers more forgiving of
        whitespace.
      - Parse `\chapter{}` in latex.
      - Changed `rawLaTeXInline` to accept `\section`, `\begin`, etc.
      - Use new `rawLaTeXInline'` in LaTeX reader, and export `rawLaTeXInline`
        for use in markdown reader.
      - Fixes bug wherein `\section{foo}` was not recognized as raw TeX
        in markdown document.

  * LaTeX writer:  images are automatically shrunk if they would extend
    beyond the page margin.

  * Plain, markdown, RST writers now use unicode for smart punctuation.

  * Man writer converts math to unicode when possible, as in other writers.

  * `markdown2pdf` can now recognize citeproc options.

  * Command-line arguments are converted to UTF-8. (Issue #234)

  * `Text.Pandoc.TeXMath` has been rewritten to use texmath's parser.
    This allows it to handle a wider range of formulas. Also, if a formula
    cannot be converted, it is left in raw TeX; formulas are no longer
    partially converted.

  * Unicode curly quotes are left alone when parsing smart quotes. (Issue
    #143)

  * Cabal file changes:

      - Removed parsec < 3 restriction.
      - Added 'threaded' flag for architectures where GHC lacks a threaded
        runtime.
      - Use 'threaded' only for markdown2pdf; it is not needed for pandoc.
      - Require highlighting-kate 0.2.7.

  * Use explicit imports from `Data.Generics`. Otherwise we have a
    conflict with the 'empty' symbol, introduced in syb >= 0.2. (Issue #237)

  * New data files:  slidy/slidy.min.js, slidy/slidy.min.css, epub.css.

pandoc (1.5.1.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

 * Fixed uniqueIdent in Shared so that header identifiers work as
   advertized in the README and are are valid XHTML names.

pandoc (1.5.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed treatment of unicode characters in URIs.
    + Shared now exports escapeURI and unescapeURI. These handle
      UTF8 encoding and decoding as well as URI escaping/unescaping.
    + Shared: uri and emailAddress now return a pair of the original
      parsed text and the escaped URI (in the latter case, with
      the mailto: prefix).
    + HTML reader: unsanitaryURI has been modified to allow unicode
      high characters in a URI.
    + Readers:  All link and image URIs are now escaped using
      escapeURI.
    + Markdown and RST writers:  unescapeURI is used so that URIs
      in these formats are human-readable.

  * Setup.hs: Don't assume that the build directory is "dist".
    Instead, get it from localBuildInfo.

  * OpenDocument writer: Use a Map for stTextStyleAttr.
    This avoids duplicates (and invalid xml). Resolves Issue #222.

pandoc (1.5.0.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * HTML writer: Fixed error in math writer (with MathML option)
    that caused an infinite loop for unparsable MathML.

pandoc (1.5)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added --mathml option.  When this is selected, pandoc will convert
    TeX math into MathML.
    + Added data/MathMLinHTML.js, which is included when no URL is
      provided for --mathml.  This allows MathML to be displayed (in
      better browsers) as text/html.
    + Removed Text.Pandoc.LaTeXMathML.  The module was no longer
      necessary; it was replaced by two lines in pandoc.hs.
    + Replaced LaTeXMathML.js.commend and LaTeXMathML.js.packed with a
      single combined file, LaTeXMathML.js.

  * Added --data-dir option.
    This specifies a user data directory. If not specified, will default
    to ~/.pandoc on unix or Application Data\pandoc on Windows.
    Files placed in the user data directory will override system default
    data files.

  * Added Maybe datadir parameter to readDataFile, saveOpenDocumentAsODT,
    latexMathMLScript, s5HeaderIncludes, and getDefaultTemplate. If
	  Nothing, no user directory is searched for an override.

  * Added 'plain' output format. This is similar to markdown, but
    removes links, pictures, inline formatting, and most anything that
    looks even vaguely markupish. The function writePlain is exported by
    Text.Pandoc.Writers.Markdown, with which it shares most of its code.

  * Allow multi-line titles and authors in meta block.
    Titles may span multiple lines, provided continuation lines
    begin with a space character.  Separate authors may be put on
    multiple lines, provided each line after the first begins with
    a space character.  Each author must fit on one line. Multiple
    authors on a single line may still be separated by a semicolon.
    Based on a patch by Justin Bogner.

  * When given an absolute URI as parameter, pandoc will try to fetch
    the content via HTTP.  So you can do:
    'pandoc -r html -w markdown http://www.fsf.org'
    Adds dependency on HTTP.

  * Made HTML reader much more forgiving.
    + Incorporated idea (from HXT) that an element can be closed
      by an open tag for another element.
    + Javascript is partially parsed to make sure that a <script>
      section is not closed by a </script> in a comment or string.
    + More lenient non-quoted attribute values.
      Now we accept anything but a space character, quote, or <>.
      This helps in parsing e.g. www.google.com!
    + Bare & signs are now parsed as a string.  This is a common
      HTML mistake.
    + Skip a bare < in malformed HTML.

  * Removed html2markdown and hsmarkdown.
    + html2markdown is no longer needed, since you can now pass URI
      arguments to pandoc and directly convert web pages. (Note,
      however, that pandoc assumes the pages are UTF8. html2markdown
      made an attempt to guess the encoding and convert them.)
    + hsmarkdown is pointless -- a large executable that could be
      replaced by 'pandoc --strict'.

  * In most writers, an image in a paragraph by itself is now rendered
    as a figure, with the alt text as the caption. (Texinfo, HTML, RST,
    MediaWiki, Docbook, LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML.) Other images are
    rendered inline.

  * Depend on extensible-exceptions.  This allows pandoc to be compiled
    on GHC 6.8.

  * Added --base-header-level option.  For example, --base-header-level=2
    will change level 1 headers to level 2, level 2 to level 3, etc.
    Closes Debian #563416.

  * Incomplete support for RST tables (simple and grid).
    Thanks to Eric Kow. Colspans and rowspans not yet supported.

  * Added accessors (docTitle, docAuthors, docDate) to Meta type.

  * MediaWiki writer:  format links with relative URLs as wikilinks.
    The new rule:  If the link target is an absolute URL, an external
    link is created. Otherwise, a wikilink is created.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared: Export uniqueIdent, and don't allow tilde in
    identifier.  Note:  This may break links to sections that involve
    tildes.

  * Markdown(+lhs) reader:  handle "inverse bird tracks."
    Inverse bird tracks (<) are used for haskell example code that is not
    part of the literate Haskell program.  Resolves Issue #211.

  * LaTeX reader:
    + Recognize '\ ' (interword space).
    + Recognize nonbreaking space '~'.
    + Ignore \section, \pdfannot, \pdfstringdef.  Ignore alt title in
      section headers.  Don't treat \section as inline LaTeX.
      Resolves Issue #202.
    + LaTeX reader:  allow any special character to be escaped.
      Resolves Issue #221.
    + LaTeX reader: treat \paragraph and \subparagraph as level 4, 5
      headers.  Resolves Issue #207.

  * Use template variables for include-before/after.
    + These options now imply -s; previously they worked also in fragment
      mode.
    + Users can now adjust position of include-before and include-after
      text in the templates.
    + Default position of include-before moved back (as it was before 1.4)
      before table of contents.
    + Resolves Issue #217.

  * Don't print an empty table header: (all writers).
    Resolves Issue #210.

  * HTML, Docbook writer: Use tbody, thead, and cols in tables.

  * HTML writer: Don't include TOC div if table of contents is empty.

  * Markdown writer:  Fixed citations.
    Previously the markdown writer printed raw citation codes, e.g.
    [geach1970], rather than the expanded citations provided by
    citeproc, e.g. (Geach 1970). Now it prints the expanded citations.
    This means that the document produced can be processed as a markdown
    document without citeproc. Thanks to dsanson for reporting, and
    Andrea Rossato for the patch.

  * Improved and simplified title block in context template.
    Previously it caused an error if there was no title.
    This method should also be easier for users to customize.

  * Markdown reader:
    + Treat p., pp., sec., ch., as abbreviations in smart mode.
    + Disallow blank lines in inline code span.
    + Allow footnotes to be indented < 4 spaces.
      This fixes a regression.  A test case has been added.
    + Escape spaces in URLs as %20. Previously they were incorrectly
		  escaped as +, which is appropriate only for the query part of
			a URL. Resolves Issue #220.
    + Require two spaces after capital letter + period for list item.
      Otherwise "E. coli" starts a list. This might change the semantics
      of some existing documents, since previously the two-space
      requirement was only enforced when the second word started
      with a capital letter. But it is consistent with the existing
      documentation and follows the principle of least surprise.
      Resolves Issue #212.

  * LaTeX template: redefine labelwidth when using enumerate package.
    Otherwise the list labels (numbers) often extend past the left
    margin, which looks bad.

  * Mediawiki writer: Don't print a "== Notes ==" header before
    references.  This is too English-centric. Writers can provide their
    own header at the end of the document.

  * Promoted mediawiki headers.  '= head =' is now level 1, '== head =='
    level 2, etc.  This seems to be correct; it's only by convention
    that wikipedia articles have level 2 headers at most.
    Patch due to Eric Kow.

  * RunTests.hs: Set LANG to a UTF-8 locale. Use 'pandoc --data-dir=' so
    data files don't need to have been installed. This removes the need to
    set HOME.

  * HTML reader:
    + Handle spaces before <html>.  Resolves Issue #216.
    + Be forgiving in parsing a bare list within a list.
      The following is not valid xhtml, but the intent is clear:
      <ol>
      <li>one</li>
      <ol><li>sub</li></ol>
      <li>two</li>
      </ol>
      We'll treat the <ol> as if it's in a <li>.  Resolves Issue #215.

  * Updated INSTALL instructions.  cabal method is now promoted.

  * Updated markdown2pdf man page. It no longer says all pandoc options
    are accepted.

  * README/man pages: Removed advice to pipe through tidy before HTML
    reader.  This is obsolete, now that we have a forgiving HTML parser.

  * LaTeX writer: set numbersections template variable, so
    the section numbering options work again.

  * Removed obsolete Makefile.

  * Website: renamed index.txt.in -> index.txt.

  * New batch file to make-windows-installer.
    + Removed old Makefile.windows
    + Added make-windows-installer.bat
    + Modified default installer name in pandoc-setup.iss

  * Removed freebsd and macports directories.
    They are no longer up to date.

  * Setup.hs:
    + Made man page building sensitive to build verbosity.
    + Improved detection of highlighting support in test hook.
    + Install wrapper scripts into cabal bin directory.
    + Also simplified installManpages.
    + Setup.hs: install manpages to mandir.  Code borrowed from darcs.

  * Changed default of writerXeTeX to False.

  * HTML writer: don't include empty UL if --toc but no sections.
    Resolves Issue #199.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + If book, report, or memoir documentclass, use \chapter{}
      for first-level headers. Otherwise use \section{}.
    + Removed stLink, link template variable. Reason: we now always
      include hyperref in the template.

  * LaTeX template:

    + Only show \author if there are some.
    + Always include hyperref package. It is used not just for links but
      for toc, section heading bookmarks, footnotes, etc. Also added
      unicode=true on hyperref options.

  * markdown2pdf: always do at least two runs. hyperref bookmarks
    require this.

  * cabal file: Removed unneeded dependency on template-haskell.

  * Windows installer - fixed bug in data file locations.
    Resolves Issue #197.

  * Deprecated --custom-header in documentation.
    Removed old "Custom Headers" section in README.

pandoc (1.4)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Pandoc will now compile with either GHC 6.10 or 6.12.
    + Don't use System.IO.UTF8 when compiling with 6.12
    + Use -fno-warn-unused-do-bind option when compiling with 6.12

  * Replaced old headers with templates.  Now users have much more
    control over the way documents appear in --standalone mode,
    and writer code is simplified.  Resolves Issues #59, 147.
    Every effort has been made to retain backwards compatibilty.
    So, the --custom-header option should still work as before.

    + Added Text.Pandoc.Templates.  This provides functions for
      retrieving default templates and for rendering templates.
    + System templates (in the pandoc data directory) can be
      overridden by user templates in $HOME/.pandoc/templates.
    + Removed Text.Pandoc.DefaultHeaders.
    + Removed data/headers directory.
    + Added templates directory.
    + Added writerTemplate and writerVariables fields to WriterOptions.
    + Removed writerTitlePrefix, writerHeader fields from WriterOptions.
    + Changed --print-default-header to --print-default-template.
    + Added --template option.
    + Added -V/--variable option to set custom template variables.

  * Pandoc no longer requires Template Haskell.  Resolves Issue #186.

    + Removed need for TH in ODT module. Instead get reference.odt from
	  data file at run time.
    + Removed TH dependency from S5 module. S5 module now exports
      s5HeaderIncludes, which pandoc.hs includes if writer is s5 and
      standalone.
    + Refactored LaTeXMathML not to use TH.

  * Meta is now Meta [Inline] [[Inline]] [Inline] rather than
    Meta [Inline] [String] String. Authors and date in Meta are now lists
    of Inline elements rather than raw strings. This means that they can
    be formatted and can include footnotes. NOTE: This may be a breaking
    change for those using pandoc as a library.

  * Added readDataFile to Text.Pandoc.Shared.  This retrieves
    a data file from the user pandoc data directory (~/.pandoc
    on unix), or, if not found there, from the system data
    directory ($CABALDIR/shared/pandoc-VERSION/). All data
    files, including templates, LaTeXMathML.js, s5 styles,
	and reference.odt, can be overridden by the user.

  * s5 files moved from data/ui/default to s5/default.

  * Use unicode instead of entities in HTML and XML output.  Resolves
    Issue #163.

  * Prettier HTML footnote references:  put anchor inside sup,
    instead of other way.  Resolves Issue #191. Thanks to
    infinity0x.

  * Added --xetex option to pandoc and markdown2pdf.
    If --xetex is specified, pandoc produces latex suitable for
    processing by xelatex, and markdown2pdf uses xelatex to create
    the PDF. Resolves Issue #185.

  * RTF writer: multiple authors now occupy multiple paragraphs rather
    than using a line break.

  * Man writer: now the "--after-body" will come after the "AUTHORS"
    section, whereas before it would come before it.  This is a
    slight break from backwards compatibility.

  * Added --reference-odt option, so users may customize the styles
    used in pandoc-generated ODT files.  Users may also place a
	default reference.odt in the ~\.pandoc directory.

  * ODT writer:
    + Indented and line-broke styles.xml so it can be modified more easily.
    + Omitted some unnecessary style declarations.
    + Don't wrap text in OpenDocument writer.  The tags are too long, making
      wrapping ugly and pointless.

  * LaTeX reader: use \\ to separate multiple authors.

  * Markdown reader: use ; as separator between authors.
    This allows you to use ',' within author names: e.g. "John Jones, Jr."

  * S5 writer: use linebreak to separate authors in title page.

  * RST reader: Allow :: before lhs code block. The RST spec requires the
    :: before verbatim blocks. This :: should not be treated as literal
    colons. Resolves Issue #189.

  * Documented pandoc 1.3's new definition list syntax in README.
    (An oversight in the last release.)

  * markdown2pdf.hs:
    + interpret ! in a log as an error line.
    + --toc now works properly.

  * Changes in RunTests.hs:
    + Use the Diff library rather than a local copy of Diff.hs.
      (This vastly increases performance.) This change means that 'cabal
      test' presupposes that the Diff library is installed.
    + Removed tests/Diff.hs from cabal file.
    + Changed RunTests to use local environment. We need at least HOME, so
      pandoc can find its data directory.

  * Updated windows installer to install data files in the app directory.

  * Windows installer now installs portable wrappers hsmarkdown and
    markdown2pdf.

pandoc (1.3)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added --id-prefix option (Issue #41). This adds a prefix to all
    automatically generated HTML identifiers, which helps prevent
    duplicate identifiers when you're generating a fragment (say a blog
    post).

  * Added --indented-code-classes option.  This specifies classes
    to use for indented code blocks.  (Patch due to buttock; Issue #87.)

  * --number-sections now affects HTML output as well as ConTeXt and LaTeX
    (Issue #150).

  * Improved syntax for markdown definition lists (Issue #24).
    Definition lists are now more compatible with PHP Markdown Extra.
    + You can have multiple definitions for a term (but still not
      multiple terms).
    + Multi-block definitions no longer need a column before each block
      (indeed, this will now cause multiple definitions).
    + The marker no longer needs to be flush with the left margin,
      but can be indented at or two spaces.  Also, ~ as well as :
      can be used as the marker (this suggestion due to David
      Wheeler.)
    + There can now be a blank line between the term and the
      definitions.

  * Better looking simple tables.  Resolves Issue #180.
    + Markdown reader: simple tables are now given column widths of 0.
    + Column width of 0 is interpreted as meaning: use default column width.
    + Writers now include explicit column width information only
      for multiline tables.  (Exception:  RTF writer, which requires
      column widths.  In this case, columns are given equal widths,
      adding up to the text width.)
    + Simple tables should now look better in most output formats.

  * Allow markdown tables without headers (Issue #50).
    The new syntax is described in README. Also allow optional line of
    dashes at bottom of simple tables.

  * Compensate for width of final table column (Issue #144).

  * Treat a backslash followed by a newline as a hard line break
    in markdown.  Resolves Issue #154.  This is a nice alternative
	to markdown's "invisible" way of indicating hardline breaks
	using lines that end with two spaces.

  * Improved performance of markdown reader by ~10% by eliminating the
    need for a separate parsing pass for notes. Raw notes are now stored
    on the first pass (which parses references), then parsed when the
    note is inserted into the AST. The stateNotes field in ParserState
    is now a list of [(String, String)] pairs instead of [(String,
    [Block])].

  * In markdown reader, treat 4 or more * or _ in a row as literal
    text.  (Trying to parse long strings of * or _ as strong or emph
	leads to exponential performance problems.)

  * Markdown reader: Use + rather than %20 for spaces in URLs.

  * Fixed htmlComment parser, adding a needed 'try'.

  * Don't print raw HTML in man output.

  * Allow . _ and ~ in header identifiers.

  * Specially mark code blocks that were "literate" in the input.
    They can then be treated differently in the writers.  This allows
    authors to distinguish bits of the literate program they are writing
    from source code examples, even if the examples are marked as
    Haskell for highlighting.  (Issue #174.)

  * Modified html+lhs output to use "haskell" highlighter instead
    of "literateHaskell". The highlighting module now adds bird tracks
	after highlighting (for HTML output), if the code block has the
	"literate" class.  This gives better results, because kate's
    haskell highlighter is much better than the literateHaskell
    highlighter.

  * Fixed handling of footnotes in titles (HTML) and headers (LaTeX).
    (Issue #137.)

  * Support for "..code-block" directive in RST reader. Not core
    RST, but used in Sphinx for code blocks annotated with syntax
    information. Thanks to Luke Plant for the patch.

  * Added "head" to list of block-level HTML tags. Resolves
    Issue #108.

  * Added stripTags to Text.Pandoc.XML.  This is used in the HTML writer.

  * Set utf-8 encoding in texinfo headers.

  * Docbook writer: add ids to sections.  Use link for internal links.
    (Issue #60.)

  * Blank lines after lists in MediaWiki writer.

  * Properly handle commented-out list items in markdown.
    Resolves Issue #142.  Example:

    - a
    <!--
    - b
    -->
    - c

  * Changed heuristic in compactify. compactify has to decide whether a
    Para that ends a list is a Para intentionally, or just because of
    the blank lines at the end of every list. In the latter case the
    Para is turned to a Plain. The old heuristic was: change final Para
    to Plain iff the other items all end in Plain. This produces bad
    results when, for example, an item contains just a Plain and an HTML
    comment, as it does in the list above. The new heuristic: change
    final Para to Plain iff the other items don't contain a Para.

  * Added % as an rst underline character.  Resolves Issue #173.

  * Fix inline math parser so that \$ is allowed in math.
    Resolves Issue #169.

  * Translate \int (integral) into unicode when using unicode math
    method. Resolves Issue #177.

  * markdown2pdf.hs improvements:
    + Use System.IO.UTF8.
    + Print error messages on last attempt.
    + Do not create a backup when overwriting a PDF (Issue #166).
    + Accept --longopt=val options.
    + Added man/man1/markdown2pdf.1 to extra-tmp-files in cabal, so that
      it is properly cleaned.

  * Added haddock comments warning that readers assume \n line endings.

  * Updated COPYRIGHT file.

  * Makefile: Changed EXECSBASE so it doesn't pull in hsmarkdown &
    markdown2pdf. Otherwise strip tries to strip shell scripts when you
    install using 'make'.

  * Changed Makefile so it doesn't build Haskell wrappers.

  * Fixed Makefile so it doesn't try to build man pages in build-doc.

  * Install pcre3.dll in Windows install script; this allows us to
    package a version of pandoc with highlighting support.

pandoc (1.2.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed regression with --preserveTabs. Brought back optPreserveTabs.
    The trick of setting tabStop to 0 to mean "preserve tabs" had a bad
    side effect: strings of 0 spaces were interpreted as indentation.
    So, with --preserve-tabs, unindented paragraphs were treated as
    code. Resolves Issue #138.

  * HTML writer:  wrap sections in divs.  Resolves Issue #70.

    + hierarchicalize has been rationalized; it builds a hierarchical
      representation of the document from the headers, and simultaneously
      gives each section a unique identifier based on the heading title.
    + Identifiers are now attached to the divs rather than
      to the headers themselves.
    + Table of content backlinks go to the beginning of the table, rather
      than to the section reference that was clicked.
    + Code for constructing identifiers has been moved to Text.Pandoc.Shared
      from the HTML writer, since it is now consumed only by
      hierarchicalize.
    + In --strict mode, pandoc just prints bare headings, as before
      (unless --toc has been specified).
    + In s5 output, it does not wrap sections in divs, as that seems to
      confuse the s5 javascript.

  * Man writer: break lines at end of each sentence. groff expects this
    and treats '.' and '?' differently when followed by line ending as
    opposed to ordinary space. Also, don't escape periods. Instead, use
    zero-width character \& to avoid unwanted interpretation of periods
    at start of line. Resolves Issue #148.

  * Markdown writer:  Added '#' and '>' to list of characters to be
    escaped in markdown output.  Removed '<', as it is not an officially
    escapable character. This partially resolves Issue #96.

  * Make --smart the default for man output format. Otherwise we have
    trouble dividing lists of endlines into sentences.

  * DocBook writer: Use language attribute to indicate source language
    in code blocks.

  * RST reader:

    + Allow # to continue list, even if the list was started with an
      explicit marker. For example:

        A. my list
		#. continued

      Resolves Issue #140.
    + Allow continuation lines in line blocks. Also added test cases for
      line blocks for RST reader. Resolves Issue #149.
    + Allow explicit links with spaces in URL: `link <to this>`_

  * Improved LaTeX reader's coverage of math modes. Remove displaymath*
    (which is not in LaTeX) and recognize all the amsmath environments
    that are alternatives to eqnarray, namely equation, equation*,
    gather, gather*, gathered, multline, multline*, align, align*,
    alignat, alignat*, aligned, alignedat, split. Resolves Issue #103.
    Thanks to shreevatsa.public for the patch.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Allow -, _, :, . in markdown attribute names. These are legal in
      XML attribute names.
    + Use non-breaking spaces in abbreviations.
    + Markdown reader: improved efficiency of abbreviation parsing.
      Instead of a separate abbrev parser, we just check for
      abbreviations each time we parse a string. This gives a huge
      performance boost with -S. Resolves Issue #141.

  * Improved efficiency of shared parsers:  hexNum, htmlComment,
    whitespace, indentSpaces.

  * Export HTMLMathMethod in Text.Pandoc.

  * Export languagesByExtension in Text.Pandoc.Highlighting.

  * Added new Haskell version of markdown2pdf, due to
    Paulo Tanimoto.  This should be more portable than the old
	shell script.

  * Made 'pandoc -v' more explicit about compiler options.
    Resolves Issue #139.

  * pandoc.hs:  Made --strict compatible with --standalone, --toc.

  * Use Paths_pandoc to get version number, instead of hard-coding it
    into Text/Pandoc.hs.

pandoc (1.2)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added support for literate Haskell. lhs support is triggered by
    '+lhs' suffixes in formats. For example, 'latex+lhs' is literate
    Haskell LaTeX. '.lhs' files are treated by default as literate
    markdown.

    + Added stateLiterateHaskell to parser state.
    + Added parser for lhsCodeBlock to Markdown, RST, LaTeX readers.
    + Added parser for |inline lhs| to LaTeX reader.
    + Added writerLiterateHaskell to WriterOptions.
    + Added lhs support to Markdown, RST, LaTeX, HTML writers.
    + Added definition of code environment to LaTeX header.
    + Added tests (run only if highlighting support compiled in).
    + Documented lhs features in man page and README.

  * In Text.Pandoc.Definition, added processWith, processWithM,
    and queryWith, and deprecated processPandoc and queryPandoc
    for these more general functions.

  * Fixed bug in mediawiki writer:  improper closing tags in tables.
    Thanks to Benct Philip Jonsson for reporting the bug.

  * Added --email-obfuscation option.

    + Added writer option for email obfuscation.
    + Implemented email obfuscation options in HTML writer.
    + Added option to option parser.
    + Documented in README and pandoc man page.
    + Resolves Issue #97.

  * LaTeX writer: fixed bug with empty table cells.
    Resolves Issue #107.  Thanks to rodja.trappe for the patch.

  * Fixed bug with header spacing in Markdown and RST writers.
    A null header (Meta [] [] []) should not cause a blank line
    at the beginning of output.  But a blank line is needed between
    a non-null header and the main text.

  * Markdown reader: Relax spacing rules for $$ in display math. Now
    space and newlines are allowed after the opening $$ and before the
    closing $$. However, the display math cannot contain an entirely
    blank line. Resolves Issue #105.

  * Markdown reader: Gobble space after Plain blocks containing only
    raw html inline. Otherwise following header blocks are not parsed
    correctly, since the parser sees blank space before them. Resolves
    Issue #124.

  * Markdown reader: Allow " as well as '' to end a latex double-quote.

  * Conditionally depend on syb and base >= 4 if ghc >= 6.10.
    Resolves Issue #109.

  * Fixed problems in RST and markdown output due to bug in pretty-1.0.1.0

    + Added hang' function to Text.Pandoc.Shared; this will be used instead
      of hang, which doesn't work properly in pretty-1.0.1.0.  When pretty
      is upgraded, we can go back to hang.
      See  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/16687
    + Use hang' (and some different techniques) in RST and markdown writers.
      Some output is now a bit different.

  * Brought citeproc support up to date for citeproc-hs-0.2.
    (Patch by Andrea Rossato.)

  * Moved all haskell source to src subdirectory.  Renamed Main.hs to
    pandoc.hs.

  * Rewrote hsmarkdown in Haskell for portability (src/hsmarkdown.hs).
    For now, keeping the old shell script too.

  * Added TemplateHaskell to Extensions for executable, removed
    -threaded for library. Thanks to duncan.coutts for the bug report.
    Resolves Issue #121.

  * Moved some Extra-Source-Files to Data-Files.

  * Moved tabFilter to Shared.

  * In pandoc.hs, removed optPreserveTabs; instead, tabstop of 0 means
    preserve tabs.

  * Minor code cleanup based on hlint suggestions.

pandoc (1.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Main.hs:

    + Changed date on copyright message in Main.hs.
    + Have the '-v' option print syntax highlighting languages
      separated by commas, and wrapped in lines, instead of in five
      columns as before.

  * Added --jsmath option.  Resolves Issue #68.

    + Added --jsmath option to Main.hs
    + Added JsMath to HTMLMathMethod in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Handle math appropriately in HTML writer when JsMath selected.
    + Documented the option in README and man page.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:  Changed compactify to use a better heuristic
    for tight and loose lists. Final Para is changed to Plain if all
    other list items *end* with a Plain block. Addresses Issue #99.

  * HTML reader:

    + Added colons to protocols in unsanitaryURI. Closes Issue #88.
    + HTML reader: Don't interpret contents of <pre> blocks as markdown.
      Added rawVerbatimBlock parser.  Resolves Issue #94.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Allow URLs with spaces in them in links and references, but escape
      them as "%20".
    + Allow blank space at the end of horizontal rules.

  * RST reader: Modified 'unknownDirective' parser to handle comment
    blocks correctly, and added tests for comment blocks. Resolves Issue
    #86. Closes Debian Bug #500662.

  * HTML writer:

    + Include classes on tr elements in HTML output:
      "header", "odd", "even".  This allows tables to be styled with
      lines in alternating colors.  Resolves Issue #91.
    + Enclose all LaTeXMathML bits in <span class="LaTeX">.
      This prevents parts of the document that are not math from being
      interpreted as math by LaTeXMathML.js.

  * OpenDocument and ODT writers:  Added support for HorizontalRule elements,
    which were formerly ignored.  Resolves Issue #95.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:  Modified wrappedTeX to eliminate the line break
    between a footnote and immediately following nonspace characters in
    LaTeX and ConTeXt output. (This gets interpreted as a space, which
    is not desired in cases like "text^[note]---".)  Resolves Issue #93.

  * Windows installer: Don't require admin privileges to run
    installer.  Modified pandoc-setup.iss, and changed modpath.iss to
    modify HKCU path if user lacks admin privileges.  Also fixed case
    where oldpath is empty (previously this led to the new path
    beginning with a semicolon).

  * Updated INSTALL instructions for Arch packages and OS X install using
    cabal-install.

  * Removed the (now unneeded) debian directory.
    Removed empty Codec and System directories.

  * Moved odt-styles/ to data/.  Removed unneeded variable in Makefile.

  * Modified Setup.hs so that the "test" target returns an error status
    when tests fail, and "build" returns a success status if
    the build succeeds.  Resolves Issue #100.

  * Added BUGS to files in tarball.


pandoc (1.0.0.1)

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Removed spurious reference to pdf output format from pandoc(1) man page.

pandoc (1.0)

  [ Andrea Rossato ]

  * Added new OpenDocument writer.

  * Added support for SmallCaps inline element.

  * Added support for integrating pandoc with citeproc-hs.

    + Added Cite element to definition and writers.
    + Added Text.Pandoc.Biblio module
    + Note: This support is included only if the 'citeproc'
      Cabal configuration flag is set.

  * Made Pandoc data structure an instance of Typeable.
    Added new processPandoc and queryPandoc functions, to query
    or transform matching elements in a Pandoc structure.

  [ Peter Wang ]

  * Added new Texinfo writer.

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Changes to Texinfo writer:

    + No space between paragraph and following @verbatim (provides more
      pleasing appearance in text formats)
    + Blank line consistently after list environments.
    + Removed deVerb.
    + Use @code instead of @verb for inline code (this solves the character
      escaping problem for texi2dvi and texi2pdf).
    + Added news of Texinfo writer to README.
    + Added Texinfo to list of formats in man page, and removed extra 'groff'.
    + Added texi & texinfo extensions to Main.hs, and fixed bug in determining
      default output extension.
    + Modified disallowedInNode in Texinfo writer to correct list of disallowed characters.

  * Added tests for OpenDocument writer.

  * Added ODT writer (using zip-archive library to package output of
    OpenDocument writer).  Added odt-styles directory with default ODT styles.

  * Added new mediawiki writer and tests.

  * Markdown reader: Added support for delimited code blocks, with optional
    syntax highlighting using highlighting-kate (if the 'highlighting'
    configuration option is selected).

    + Currently highlighting is supported only in the HTML writer.
    + Delimited code blocks can have attributes; using the language name as
      class triggers highlighting.
    + New Attributes parameter in CodeBlock structure.
    + --version now indicates whether syntax highlighting support is compiled
      in, and prints a list of supported languages

  * Removed debian directory. Pandoc is no longer a native debian package.

  * Changes to build process:  pandoc can now be built from the repository
    using Cabal.  No unix tools are needed (so, pandoc can be built on Windows
    without Cygwin).

    + Include shell scripts themselves in repo, rather than generating from wrappers.
      Removed wrappers directory and wrappers Makefile target.
    + Text/Pandoc/ASCIIMathML.hs, Text/Pandoc/DefaultHeaders.hs,
      and Text/Pandoc/Writers/S5.hs are no longer built in Makefile
      from templates in the templates/ directory. Instead, they use template
      haskell to read data at compile time from the relevant files in data/.
      Template haskell functions go in a new module, Text.Pandoc.TH.
    + man pages are now generated in Setup.hs hook, not by Makefile
    + Makefile 'tarball' target now calls Cabal's 'sdist'
    + Added "Extra-Source-Files" to pandoc.cabal, so sdist contains everything needed
    + Added "Build-Type" field to pandoc.cabal to avoid warning.
    + Added to "Extra-source-files" and "Extra-tmp-files" in pandoc.cabal,
      so 'sdist' and 'clean' will work properly.
    + Setup.hs now generates man pages in a postbuild hook.
    + Added dependency-checking to Setup.hs, so it only rebuilds things
      that need rebuilding.
    + Added 'library' and 'executable' configuration flags.
      Cabal can now be told to build just the library or just the executable.
    + CABALOPTS may now be specified with 'make' to pass Cabal configuration flags.
      For example:  CABALOPTS=-fhighlighting make

  * Rewrote test suite so it doesn't depend on perl or unix tools.

    + Replaced old runtests.pl with a Haskell script RunTests.hs.
    + Added Diff.hs module to be used by RunTests.hs instead of unix 'diff'.
    + Added test hook to Setup.hs, so tests may be run from cabal.
    + Changed Makefile's 'test' target to run tests via cabal.
    + Removed old generate.sh.
    + Since we no longer have 'sed' to filter out raw HTML sections
      from the docbook writer test, or raw LaTeX sections from the
      context writer test, we now just include these sections.
      They can be taken out if it is necessary to process the files.
    + Updated latex and context writer tests to remove extra spaces
      after '\\item'
    + Added a markdown table reader test.
    + Added markdown-reader-more.txt to test suite, for additional test cases
      for raw ConTeXt environments and more.

  * Compatibility fixes for CPP, Cabal, and haddock:

    + Use CPP in "Extensions" field in pandoc.cabal.
    + Removed use of backslash string continuations in source files.

  * Removed pandoc.cabal.ghc66.  We now require Cabal >= 1.2, GHC >= 6.8,
    base >= 3.

  * Require parsec < 3.
    The compatibility module in parsec 3.0.0 gives far worse performance than
    parsec 2.1.  Eventually pandoc will be upgraded to use the new bytestring
    version of parsec, and then we'll go to parsec 3.0.0.

  * Removed Text.Regex dependencies by rewriting using plain Haskell
    (Text.Pandoc.Writers.RTF, Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML, Main.hs)

  * Moved Text.Pandoc.Writers.DefaultHeaders -> Text.Pandoc.DefaultHeaders.

  * Makefile:

    + Added 'configure' as dependency of 'uninstall-all'.
      (It uses the Cabal build program.)
    + Makefile:  only use --with-hc-pkg if GHC_PKG is defined.
      Note that Cabal will automatically choose the ghc-pkg appropriate
      for the compiler selected, so normally specifying GHC by itself
      is sufficient.

  * Removed Text.Pandoc.UTF8 module; instead, depend on utf8-string and use
    its IO and conversion functions.

  * Added -Wall to ghc-options in pandoc.cabal.  Cleaned up modules so that
    everything is -Wall clean.

    + Added pragma to HTML writer to avoid deprecation warning for use of "start" attribute.
    + Added pragma to Text/Pandoc/Shared.hs to get rid of "orphan instance" warnings.
      (These are caused by the Lift instance for ByteString.)

  * Changed the comment used to replace unsafe HTML if sanitize-html option
    selected.

  * Made -c/--css option repeatable on the command line (like -H, -A, -B).

  * Moved XML-formatting functions to new unexported module Text.Pandoc.XML.

  * Escape '\160' as "&#160;", not "&nbsp;" in XML.
    "nbsp" isn't a predefined XML entity.

  * Fixed bug in RST reader, which would choke on: "p. one\ntwo\n".
    Added some try's in ordered list parsers.

  * Man writer:  don't escape " as \".

  * Allow newline before URL in markdown link references.  Resolves Issue #81.
    Added tests for this issue in new "markdown-reader-more" tests.
    Changed RunTests.hs to run these tests.

  * Support for display math.  Resolves Issue #47.

    + Added a DisplayMath/InlineMath selector to Math inlines.
    + Markdown parser yields DisplayMath for $$...$$.
    + LaTeX parser yields DisplayMath when appropriate.  Removed
      mathBlock parsers, since the same effect is achieved by the math
      inline parsers, now that they handle display math.
    + Writers handle DisplayMath as appropriate for the format.
    + Modified tests accordingly; added new tests for display math.

  * Use LaTeXMathML instead of ASCIIMathML.  LaTeXMathML is closer
    to LaTeX in its display of math, and supports many non-math LaTeX environments.

    + Changed -m option to use LaTeXMathML rather than ASCIIMathML.
    + Modified HTML writer to print raw TeX when LaTeXMathML is
      being used instead of suppressing it.
    + Removed ASCIIMathML files from data/ and added LaTeXMathML.
    + Replaced ASCIIMathML with LaTeXMathML in source files.
    + Modified README and pandoc man page source.
    + Added --latexmathml option (kept --asciimathml as a synonym
      for backwards compatibility)

  * Markdown reader: Parse setext headers before atx headers.
    Test case:
       # hi
       ====
    parsed by Markdown.pl as an H1 header with contents "# hi".

  * Markdown reader: Treat "mixed" lists the same way as Markdown.pl does.
    The marker on the first list item determines the type of the whole
    list.  Thus, a list like
       1. one
       -  two
       *  three
    gets parsed as a single ordered list.  (Previous versions of pandoc
    treated this as an ordered list with an unordered sublist.)

  * Markdown smart typography:

    + Em dashes no longer eat surrounding whitespace.  Resolves Issue #69.
    + Use nonbreaking spaces after known abbreviations in markdown parser.
      Thus, for example, "Mr. Brown" comes out as "Mr.~Brown" in LaTeX, and does
      not produce a sentence-separating space.  Resolves Issue #75.

  * Markdown writer: Print unicode \160 literally, rather than as &nbsp;.

  * Treat '\ ' in (extended) markdown as nonbreaking space.
    Print nonbreaking space appropriately in each writer (e.g. ~ in LaTeX).

  * The '--sanitize-html' option now examines URIs in markdown links
    and images, and in HTML href and src attributes.  If the URI scheme
    is not on a whitelist of safe schemes, it is rejected.  The main point
    is to prevent cross-site scripting attacks using 'javascript:' URIs.
    See http://www.mail-archive.com/markdown-discuss@six.pairlist.net/msg01186.html
    and http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html.  Resolves Issue #62.

  * HTML writer:

    + Override Text.XHtml's stringToHtml function,
      so that characters below 0xff are not converted to numerical entity
      references. Also convert '\160' to "&nbsp;". This should aid readability
      and editability of the HTML source. It does presuppose that the HTML
      will be served as UTF-8.
    + In code blocks, change leading newlines to <br /> tags.
      (Some browsers ignore them.)  Resolves Issue #71.
      See http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2008-May/001297.html
    + Use style attributes rather than css classes for strikethrough
      and ordered list styles.  This works better when fragments, rather than
      standalone documents, are generated.

  * HTML reader: Count anything that isn't a known block (HTML) tag as an
    inline tag (rather than the other way around).  Added "html", "head", and
    "body" to list of block tags.  Resolves Issue #66, allowing
    <lj> to count as an inline tag.

  * RTF writer: Fixed bug.  Extra spaces were being printed after emphasized,
    boldface, and other inline elements.  Resolves Issue #64.

  * LaTeX reader:  improvements in raw LaTeX parsing.

    + "loose punctuation" (like {}) parsed as Space
    + Para elements must contain more than Str "" and Space elements
    + Added parser for "\ignore" command used in literate haskell.
    + Reworked unknownCommand and rawLaTeXInline: when not in "parse raw"
      mode, these parsers simply strip off the command part and allow
      the arguments to be parsed normally.  So, for example,
      \blorg{\emph{hi}} will be parsed as Emph "hi" rather than
      Str "{\\emph{hi}}".
    + Parse lhs "code" environments as verbatim.
      Refactored parsers for verbatim environments.
    + Removed specialEnvironment parser.
    + parse '{}', if present, after \textless, \textgreater,
      \textbar, \textbackslash, \ldots.
    + Parse unescaped special characters verbatim rather than
      changing them to spaces.  This way arguments of unknown
      commands will appear in braces.

  * Parse raw ConTeXt environments as TeX in markdown reader.
    Resolves Issue #73.

  * Moved BlockWrapper and wrappedBlocksToDoc from ConTeXt writer to Shared.

  * Made some structural changes to parsing of raw LaTeX environments.
    Previously there was a special block parser for LaTeX environments.
    It returned a Para element containing the raw TeX inline. This has
    been removed, and the raw LaTeX environment parser is now used in the
    rawLaTeXInline parser. The effect is exactly the same, except that we
    can now handle consecutive LaTeX and ConTeXt environments not separated
    by spaces.  This new flexibility is required by the example in
    Issue #73:

        \placeformula \startformula
             L_{1} = L_{2}
        \stopformula

    API change: The LaTeX reader now exports rawLaTeXEnvironment' (which
    returns a string) rather than rawLaTeXEnvironment (which returns a block
    element). This is more likely to be useful in other applications.

  * Use \textsubscr instead of \textsubscript for LaTeX subscript macro.
    \textsubscript conflicts with a definition in the memoir class.
    Resolves Issue #65.

  * Removed unneeded space after "\\item" in LaTeX and ConTeXt output.

  * Added amsmath package to default LaTeX header. Resolves Issue #48.

  * Added \setupitemize[autointro] to ConTeXt header, to prevent orphaned
    list introduction lines.

  * Changed Float to Double in definition of Table element.
    (Double is more efficient in GHC.)

  * Fixed bug in Markdown parser:  regular $s triggering math mode.
    For example:  "shoes ($20) and socks ($5)."
    The fix consists in two new restrictions:

    + the $ that ends a math span may not be directly followed by a digit.
    + no blank lines may be included within a math span.

    Thanks to Joseph Reagle for noticing the bug.

  * Use Data.List's 'intercalate' instead of custom 'joinWithSep'.
    Removed 'joinWithSep' from Text.Pandoc.Shared.

  * Updated README and man pages.  Acknowledge contributors in README.
    Added paragraph to README about producing S5 with separate CSS/javascript.

  * Updated INSTALL to reflect new build system (including configuration
    options) and document new dependencies.  Added note to INSTALL that
    Cabal >= 1.2 is required for build.  Resolves Issue #74.

  * Fixed some haddock documentation errors.

  * Small fix to markdown2pdf man page: only input needs to be piped through iconv.

pandoc (0.46) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Made -H, -A, and -B options cumulative: if they are specified
    multiple times, multiple files will be included.

  * Added optional HTML sanitization using a whitelist.
    When this option is specified (--sanitize-html on the command line),
    unsafe HTML tags will be replaced by HTML comments, and unsafe HTML
    attributes will be removed.  This option should be especially useful
    for those who want to use pandoc libraries in web applications, where
    users will provide the input.

    + Main.hs:  Added --sanitize-html option.

    + Text.Pandoc.Shared:  Added stateSanitizeHTML to ParserState.

    + Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML:
      - Added whitelists of sanitaryTags and sanitaryAttributes.
      - Added parsers to check these lists (and state) to see if a given
        tag or attribute should be counted unsafe.
      - Modified anyHtmlTag and anyHtmlEndTag to replace unsafe tags
        with comments.
      - Modified htmlAttribute to remove unsafe attributes.
      - Modified htmlScript and htmlStyle to remove these elements if
        unsafe.

    + Modified README and man pages to document new option.

  * Improved handling of email addresses in markdown and reStructuredText.
    Consolidated uri and email address parsers.  (Resolves Issue #37.)

    + New emailAddress and uri parsers in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
      - uri parser uses parseURI from Network.URI.
      - emailAddress parser properly handles email addresses with periods
        in them.

    + Removed uri and emailAddress parsers from Text.Pandoc.Readers.RST
      and Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Fixed emph parser so that "*hi **there***" is parsed as a Strong
      nested in an Emph. (A '*' is only recognized as the end of the
      emphasis if it's not the beginning of a strong emphasis.)

    + Moved blockQuote parser before list parsers for performance.

    + Modified 'source' parser to allow backslash-escapes in URLs.
      So, for example, [my](/url\(1\)) yields a link to /url(1).
      Resolves Issue #34.

    + Disallowed links within links. (Resolves Issue #35.)
      - Replaced inlinesInBalanced with inlinesInBalancedBrackets, which
        instead of hard-coding the inline parser takes an inline parser
        as a parameter.
      - Modified reference and inlineNote to use inlinesInBalancedBrackets.
      - Removed unneeded inlineString function.
      - Added inlineNonLink parser, which is now used in the definition of
        reference.
      - Added inlineParsers list and redefined inline and inlineNonLink parsers
        in terms of it.
      - Added failIfLink parser.

    + Better handling of parentheses in URLs and quotation marks in titles.
      - 'source' parser first tries to parse URL with balanced parentheses;
        if that doesn't work, it tries to parse everything beginning with
        '(' and ending with ')'.
      - source parser now uses an auxiliary function source'.
      - linkTitle parser simplified and improved, under assumption that it
        will be called in context of source'.

    + Make 'block' conditional on strictness state, instead of using
      failIfStrict in block parsers. Use a different ordering of parsers
      in strict mode (raw HTML block before paragraph) for performance.
      In non-strict mode use rawHtmlBlocks instead of htmlBlock.
      Simplified htmlBlock, since we know it's only called in strict
      mode.

    + Improved handling of raw HTML.  (Resolves Issue #36.)
      - Tags that can be either block or inline (e.g. <ins>) should
        be treated as block when appropriate and as inline when
        appropriate. Thus, for example,
        <ins>hi</ins>
        should be treated as a paragraph with inline <ins> tags, while
        <ins>
        hi
        </ins>
        should be treated as a paragraph within <ins> tags.
      - Moved htmlBlock after para in list of block parsers.  This ensures
        that tags that can be either block or inline get parsed as inline
        when appropriate.
      - Modified rawHtmlInline' so that block elements aren't treated as
        inline.
      - Modified para parser so that paragraphs containing only HTML tags and
        blank space are not allowed.  Treat these as raw HTML blocks instead.

    + Fixed bug wherein HTML preceding a code block could cause it to
      be parsed as a paragraph.  The problem is that the HTML parser
      used to eat all blank space after an HTML block, including the
      indentation of the code block.  (Resolves Issue #39.)
      - In Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML, removed parsing of following space
        from rawHtmlBlock.
      - In Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown, modified rawHtmlBlocks so that
        indentation is eaten *only* on the first line after the HTML
        block.  This means that in
        <div>
             foo
        <div>
        the foo won't be treated as a code block, but in
        <div>

            foo

        </div>
        it will.  This seems the right approach for least surprise.

  * RST reader:

    + Fixed bug in parsing explicit links (resolves Issue #44).
      The problem was that we were looking for inlines until a '<' character
      signaled the start of the URL; so, if you hit a reference-style link,
      it would keep looking til the end of the document.  Fix:  change
      inline => (notFollowedBy (char '`') >> inline).  Note that this won't
      allow code inlines in links, but these aren't allowed in resT anyway.

    + Cleaned up parsing of reference names in key blocks and links.
      Allow nonquoted reference links to contain isolated '.', '-', '_', so
      so that strings like 'a_b_' count as links.

    + Removed unnecessary check for following link in str.
      This is unnecessary now that link is above str in the definition of
      'inline'.

  * HTML reader:

    + Modified rawHtmlBlock so it parses </html> and </body> tags.
      This allows these tags to be handled correctly in Markdown.
      HTML reader now uses rawHtmlBlock', which excludes </html> and </body>,
      since these are handled in parseHtml.  (Resolves Issue #38.)

    + Fixed bug (emph parser was looking for <IT> tag, not <I>).

    + Don't interpret contents of style tags as markdown.
      (Resolves Issue #40.)
      - Added htmlStyle, analagous to htmlScript.
      - Use htmlStyle in htmlBlockElement and rawHtmlInline.
      - Moved "script" from the list of tags that can be either block or
        inline to the list of block tags.

    + Modified rawHtmlBlock to use anyHtmlBlockTag instead of anyHtmlTag
      and anyHtmlEndTag.  This fixes a bug in markdown parsing, where
      inline tags would be included in raw HTML blocks.

    + Modified anyHtmlBlockTag to test for (not inline) rather than
      directly for block.  This allows us to handle e.g. docbook in
      the markdown reader.

  * LaTeX reader:  Properly recognize --parse-raw in rawLaTeXInline.
    Updated LaTeX reader test to use --parse-raw.

  * HTML writer:

    + Modified rules for automatic HTML header identifiers to
      ensure that identifiers begin with an alphabetic character.
      The new rules are described in README.  (Resolves Issue #33.)

    + Changed handling of titles in HTML writer so you don't get
      "titleprefix - " followed by nothing.

  * ConTeXt writer: Use wrappers around Doc elements to ensure proper
    spacing.  Each block element is wrapped with either Pad or Reg.
    Pad'ed elements are guaranteed to have a blank line in between.

  * RST writer:

    + Refactored RST writer to use a record instead of a tuple for state,
      and to include options in state so it doesn't need to be passed as
      a parameter.

    + Use an interpreted text role to render math in restructuredText.
      See http://www.american.edu/econ/itex2mml/mathhack.rst for the
      strategy.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Debian packaging changes:

    + Remove the empty 'include' directory in -dev package, which lintian
      complains about.
    + Bump Standarts-Version to 3.7.3.
    + Use new 'Homepage:' field to specify the upstream URL on suggestion of
      lintian.

pandoc (0.45) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Simplified parsing of reference keys and notes in markdown and RST
    readers: The Reference data structure from Text.Pandoc.Shared is no
    longer needed, since referenceKey and noteBlock parses return strings
    (as many blank lines as were occupied by the key or note) and update
    state themselves.  getPosition and setPosition are now used to ensure
    that error messages will give the correct line number. This yields
    cleaner (and slightly faster) code, with more accurate parsing error
    messages.

  * Added new Math inline element:

    + Markdown and LaTeX readers now convert TeX math into Math elements,
      not TeX.
    + This allows math to be treated differently from raw TeX in output.
      TeX elements are no longer printed in output formats other than
      Markdown, LaTeX, and ConTeXt.  But Math elements are always printed.

  * New default handling of math in writers:

    + New module Text.Pandoc.Readers.TeXMath exports readTeXMath, which
      parses raw TeX math and outputs a string of Pandoc inlines that
      tries to render it as far as possible using unicode characters,
      lapsing into literal TeX when needed.
    + readTeXMath is now used for default HTML output in HTML, S5, RTF,
      and Docbook, if no other method for displaying math in HTML is
      specified.  Enclosing $'s are no longer printed by default.
    + By default, math is put inside <span class="math">. This way it can be
      distinguished from the surrounding text, e.g. put in a different
      font.

  * New --gladtex and --mimetex options for display of math in HTML:

    + If --gladtex is specified, math is output between <eq> tags, so
      it can be processed by gladTeX.
    + If --mimetex is specified, math is put in <img> tags with a link
      to the mimetex CGI script (or any other script that takes TeX math
      as input and outputs an image).  The URL of the script may be
      specified, but defaults to /cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi.
    + HTMLMathMethod structure in WriterOptions keeps track of how to
      display math in HTML output.
    + Updated README with a description of the four options for displaying
      math in HTML.

  * HTML reader:

    + Fixed bug: parser for minimized attributes should not swallow
      trailing spaces.
    + Simplified HTML attribute parsing.
    + Changed parsing of code blocks in HTML reader:  <code> tag is no
      longer needed. <pre> suffices. All HTML tags in the code block
      (e.g. for syntax highlighting) are skipped, because they are not
      portable to other output formats. A <code>...</code> block not
      surrounded by <pre> now counts as inline HTML, not a code block.
    + Remove just one leading and one trailing newline from contents of
      <pre>...</pre> in codeBlock parser.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Removed support for box-style block quotes.
    + Require space before title in links and references.
      This fixes a bug in parsing URLs like http://silly/url(withparen).
    + Improved and simplified setextHeader parser.
    + Fixed logic in smart quote parsing, adding some needed 'try'
      statements.
    + Fixed smart quote parsing so that unicode characters 8216 and 8217
      are recognized as single quotes, and 8220 and 8221 as double quotes.

  * RST reader:

    + Fixed bug in parsing of code blocks. Previously a full tab indent
      was required, but RST allows code to be indented any amount.
      Resolves Issue #27.
    + Allow field lists to be indented.
    + Parse the contents of field lists instead of treating as a raw string.
    + Represent field lists as definition lists instead of blockquotes.
    + Fixed bug in which metadata would be overridden if the document
      contained multiple field lists.
    + Parse fields associated with '.. image::' blocks, and use 'alt'
      field, if given, for image alt and title attributes.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Modified specialChar so that '"' characters are parsed.
    + Fixed a bug in parsing of \[ \] math blocks (thanks to Mark Kalderon).

  * HTML writer:

    + Changes in handling of math (see above).
    + Don't produce HTML for table of contents if there are
      no headers. (This would be an empty list, which is invalid XHTML.)

  * Markdown writer:

    + Don't print title attribute if title is empty. (This differs from
      the behavior of Markdown.pl, and agrees with PHP Markdown. But John
      Gruber has indicated that he prefers this behavior.) Adjusted test
      suite accordingly.
    + Fixed incorrect line wrapping in paragraphs including hard line
      breaks. Resolves Issue #25.
    + Fixed bug in markdown writer:  If an ordered list item began with
      a marker greater than 3 characters in width, and the item took more
      than one line, it would appear on the line after the list marker,
      e.g.:

          (12)
              My list item.
              Multiline.

      Now it works as follows:

          (12) My list item.
              Multiline.

  * RST writer

    + Fixed bug in RST writer's handling of ordered lists. Previously,
      list items with multiple lines would not always line up with
      single-line list items. Now, list items are nested the length of
      the list marker + 1. This looks better and ensures that list items
      all line up. (Note that list markers are padded to the length of
      the longest list marker in the series.)
    + Use 3-space indent for unordered lists.
    + If label for a link reference contains a colon, surround it by `
      signs so it won't be interpreted as the end of the link label.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Cleaner output for footnotes. Footnotes now always begin on a new
      line, and the final } is on a line by itself only when it needs to
      be (i.e. only when the note ends with a Verbatim environment).
    + Added writer options to state, so state doesn't need to be passed as
      a parameter.
    + Text wrapping now provided, using wrapTeXIfNeeded.

  * ConTeXt writer:  many improvements for more idiomatic ConTeXt output
    (thanks to Idris Samawi Hamid for suggestions).

    + PrettyPrint module now used for output.
    + Writer options are now in state, so they don't have to be passed as
      a parameter.
    + Text wrapping now provided, using wrapTeXIfNeeded.
    + Better treatment of footnotes:  footnotes are always on lines by
      themselves, and the final } is on a line by itself only when
      it needs to be (after \stoptyping).
    + Use \subject, \subsubject, ... or \section, \subsection, ... for headings,
      depending on whether --number-sections option is selected.
    + Extra blank line inserted after \stopitemize
    + Use new, "official" definition of blockquote environment. Also, use
      blank line after \startblockquote to balance blank line at the end.
    + Both itemized and enumerated lists are now generated using
      \start-stopitemize, with appropriate options. Removed definitions
      of ltxenum and ltxitem, which are no longer needed. Provided
      defaults for itemized lists in the preamble. State keeps track of
      ordered list level, so that when default numbering is specified,
      the appropriate scheme can be used.
    + Changed \useurl to \useURL.
    + Changed link color from red to blue.
    + Use \subsubsubsubsection etc., since these are supported
      (up to at least sub x 5).

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:

    + Save and restore position in parseFromString, so that accurate
      error messages can be given.
    + Improved efficiency of romanNumeral parser.
    + Added wrappedTeX and wrapTeXIfNeeded functions.  These ensure
      that footnotes occur on lines by themselves (to make them
      easier to see and move) and do not screw up line wrapping.

  * Text.Pandoc.UTF8:  modified fromUTF8 to strip out the BOM
    if present.  Windows Notepad and other applications insert a
    BOM at the beginning of a UTF8 file.

  * Main.hs (tabFilter): Treat '\r' at end of line as newline (in
    addition to "\r\n" and '\n').

  * Added a writer option for wrapped text and a command-line option
    '--no-wrap', which disables text wrapping and minimizes whitespace
    in HTML. (Resolves Issue #26.)

    + Added support for '--no-wrap' to Main.hs.
    + Added wrapIfNeeded function to Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Use wrapIfNeeded instead of wrapped in the RST, Man, Docbook, and
      Markdown writers.
    + Added render and renderFragment helpers to HTML writer.

  * Modified html2markdown to run tidy only if the HTML cannot be
    parsed. Previously html2markdown piped all input through tidy
    before passing it to pandoc. This caused problems on certain pages
    (e.g. http://daringfireball.com/markdown) which have well-formed
    XHTML that causes tidy to choke. The solution is to pipe through
    tidy only if pandoc cannot parse the input by itself. This means
    that a temp file is now always used, even when input comes from a
    local file or standard input.

  * Removed 'version' constant from Main.hs; added 'pandocVersion' to
    Text.Pandoc library.

  * pandoc.cabal:

    + Modified to work with GHC 6.8 and Cabal configurations. (For GHC
      6.8, pretty and containers must be added to Build-Depends, and it
      is desirable to use the -O2 compiler option.)  Cabal configurations
      allows one to select options depending on the compiler version.
      For GHC 6.6, the splitBase option can be disabled.
    + pandoc.cabal.ghc66 is provided for users with older versions of
      Cabal, which do not support configurations.
    + Use Ghc-Prof-Options to ensure that '-auto-all' is used when
      '--enable-(executable|library)-profiling' is specified. Updated
      PROFILING instructions accordingly.

  * Makefile:

    + Makefile now checks GHC version. If GHC is 6.6, pandoc.cabal.ghc66
      is copied to pandoc.cabal, and the old pandoc.cabal is copied
      to pandoc.cabal.orig. Otherwise, pandoc.cabal is copied to
      pandoc.cabal.orig but otherwise unmodified. This way, the Makefile
      will work properly with either GHC 6.6 or 6.8.
    + Changed BUILDCONF to point to dist/setup-config, not .setup-config.
      This is where current versions of Cabal put it.
    + Added $(BUILDCMD) target, so setup doesn't get compiled every time.
    + Removed dependency of templates on ./templates, which is circular
      now that templates is a subdirectory of the top-level.

  * MacPorts Portfile:

    + Modified to install the pandoc library in addition to programs.
    + Installation must be done manually rather than using Makefile's
      install-all.
    + Note that the library must be registered in the activate phase,
      after the library files have been copied out of the destroot.
      Cabal generates a 'register.sh' script that will do this.

  * debian/control: Added libghc6-network-dev, libghc6-xhtml-dev, and
    libghc6-mtl-dev as dependencies for libghc6-pandoc-dev.
    Closes: #445235

  * debian/rules:  Converted to UTF-8.

  * Changed pandoc home page to http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/.

  * Updated ASCIIMathML.js to latest version.

  * Directory structure:

    + Moved everything from src into the top-level directory.
    + Changed references to source directory in Makefile and
      pandoc.cabal.*.
    + Moved ASCIIMathML.js, headers, and ui into templates directory.
    + Modified fillTemplates.pl to reflect new paths.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Makefile: Fixed the issue of having two copies of the library
    documentation under some usage scenarios.

  * Replaced 'ghc' with '$(GHC)' in Makefile, and made GHC
    and GHC_PKG configurable through the environment, to support
    unusual ghc installations.  For example:
    GHC=/opt/ghc/bin/ghc GHC_PKG=/opt/ghc/bin/ghc-pkg make

pandoc (0.44) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed bug in HTML writer:  when --toc was used, anchors were put around
    headers, which is invalid XHTML (block content within inline element).
    Now the anchors are put inside the header tags.  Resolves Issue #23.

  * Added xmlns attribute to html element in html writer tests.
    This attribute is added by more recent versions of the
    xhtml library (>= 3000), and is required for valid XHTML.

  * On configure, compile 'Setup.hs' to 'setup' and use 'setup' as the build
    command instead of 'runhaskell', which, on some platforms (such as s390,
    alpha, m68k), throws the following error:

        runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/usr
        ghc-6.6.1: not built for interactive use

    This causes a serious FTBFS bug.  Closes: #440668.

pandoc (0.43) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * The focus of this release is performance.  The markdown parser
    is about five times faster than in 0.42, based on benchmarks
    with the TextMate manual.

  * Main.hs: Replaced CRFilter and tabFilter with single function
    tabFilter, which operates on the whole string rather than breaking
    it into lines, and handles dos-style line-endings as well as tabs.

  * Added separate LaTeX reader and native reader tests; removed
    round-trip tests.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:

    + Removed tabsToSpaces and tabsInLine (they were used only in Main.hs.)
    + General code cleanup (to elimante warnings when compiling with -Wall.)
    + Added 'wrapped' function, which helps wrap text into paragraphs,
      using the prettyprinting library.
    + Rewrote charsInBalanced and charsInBalanced'.
        - Documented restriction: open and close must be distinct characters.
        - Rearranged options for greater efficiency.
        - Bug fix: Changed inner call to charsInBalanced inside
          charsInBalanced' to charsInBalanced'.
    + anyLine now requires that the line end with a newline (not eof).
      This is a harmless assumption, since we always add newlines to the
      end of a block before parsing with anyLine, and it yields a 10% speed
      boost.
    + Removed unnecessary 'try' in anyLine.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' from romanNumeral parser.
    + Use notFollowedBy instead of notFollowedBy' in charsInBalanced.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' in parseFromString.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' from stringAnyCase.  (Now it behaves
      like 'string'.)
    + Changed definition of 'enclosed' in Text.Pandoc.Shared so that
      'try' is not automatically applied to the 'end' parser. Added
      'try' in calls to 'enclosed' where needed. Slight speed increase.

  * Writers:

    + Replaced individual wrapping routines in RST, Man, and Markdown
      writers with 'wrapped' from Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Rewrote LaTeX writer to use the prettyprinting library,
      so we get word wrapping, etc.
    + Modified latex writer tests for new latex writer using prettyprinter.
    + Fixed bug in LaTeX writer: autolinks would not cause
      '\usepackage{url}' to be put in the document header. Also, changes
      to state in enumerated list items would be overwritten.
    + In Markdown writer, escape paragraphs that begin with ordered list
      markers, so they don't get interpreted as ordered lists.

  * Text.Pandoc.Reades.LaTeX:

    + Fixed bug in LaTeX reader, which wrongly assumed that the roman
      numeral after "enum" in "setcounter" would consist entirely of
      "i"s. 'enumiv' is legitimate.
    + LaTeX command and environment names can't contain numbers.
    + Rearranged order of parsers in inline for slight speed improvement.
    + Added '`' to special characters and 'unescapedChar'.

  * Text.Pandoc.Readers.RST:

    + Removed unneeded try's in RST reader; also minor code cleanup.
    + Removed tabchar.
    + Rearranged parsers in inline (doubled speed).

  * Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown:

    + Skip notes parsing if running in strict mode. (This yields a nice
      speed improvement in strict mode.)
    + Simplify autolink parsing code, using Network.URI to test for
      URIs. Added dependency on network library to debian/control and
      pandoc.cabal.
    + More perspicuous definition of nonindentSpaces.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' in 'rawLine'.
    + Combined linebreak and whitespace into a new whitespace parser, to
      avoid unnecessary reparsing of space characters.
    + Removed unnecessary 'try' in 'codeBlock', 'ellipses', 'noteMarker',
      'multilineRow', 'dashedLine', 'rawHtmlBlocks'.
    + Use lookAhead in parsers for setext headers and definition lists
      to see if the next line begins appropriately; if not, don't waste
      any more time parsing.
    + Don't require blank lines after code block. (It's sufficient to
      end code block with a nonindented line.)
    + Changed definition of 'emph': italics with '_' must not
      be followed by an alphanumeric character. This is to help
      prevent interpretation of e.g. [LC_TYPE]: my_type as
      '[LC<em>TYPE]:my</em>type'.
    + Improved Markdown.pl-compatibility in referenceLink: the two parts
      of a reference-style link may be separated by one space, but not
      more... [a] [link], [not]    [a link].
    + Fixed markdown inline code parsing so it better accords with
      Markdown.pl: the marker for the end of the code section is a clump
      of the same number of `'s with which the section began, followed
      by a non-` character. So, for example,
         ` h ``` i ` -> <code>h ``` i</code>.
    + Split 'title' into 'linkTitle' and 'referenceTitle', since the
      rules are slightly different.
    + Rewrote 'para' for greater efficiency.
    + Rewrote link parsers for greater efficiency.
    + Removed redundant 'referenceLink' in definition of inline (it's
      already in 'link').
    + Refactored escapeChar so it doesn't need 'try'.
    + Refactored hrule for performance in Markdown reader.
    + More intelligent rearranging of 'inline' so that most frequently
      used parsers are tried first.
    + Removed tabchar parser, as whitespace handles tabs anyway.

  * Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences:

    + Refactored.
    + Removed unnecessary 'try's for a speed improvement.
    + Removed unnecessary '&' and ';' from the entity table.

  * Build process:

    + Makefile: Get VERSION from cabal file, not Main.hs.
    + Modified MacPorts Portfile:
        - Depend on haddock
        - Build and install libraries and library documentation in
          addition to pandoc executable
        - Added template item for md5 sum in Portfile.in.
        - Incorporated changes from MacPorts repository (r28278).
    + FreeBSD port:  Don't try to generate distinfo in Makefile.
      It can be made using 'make makesum' in FreeBSD.
    + Make both freebsd and macports targets depend on tarball.

  * Website and documentation:

    + Updated INSTALL instructions.
    + Added pandocwiki demo to website.
    + Removed local references to Portfile, since pandoc is now in the
      MacPorts repository.

pandoc (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Main.hs: Use utf8 conversion on the extra files loaded with
    the -H, -C, -B, and -A options.  This fixes problems with unicode
    characters in these files.

  * Exposed Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML, since it is imported in
    Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML and without it we get a linking error when
    using the library.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Added new rule for enhanced markdown ordered lists: if the list
      marker is a capital letter followed by a period (including a
      single-letter capital roman numeral), then it must be followed by
      at least two spaces. The point of this is to avoid accidentally
      treating people's initials as list markers: a paragraph might begin,
      "B. Russell was an English philosopher," and this shouldn't be
      treated as a list.  Documented change in README.
    + Blocks that start with "p. " and a digit are no longer treated
      as ordered lists (it's a page number).
    + Added a needed 'try' to listItem.
    + Removed check for a following setext header in endline.
      A full test is too inefficient (doubles benchmark time), and the
      substitute we had before is not 100% accurate.
    + Don't use Code elements for autolinks if --strict specified.

  * LaTeX writer:  When a footnote ends with a Verbatim environment, the
    close } of the footnote cannot occur on the same line or an error occurs.
    Fixed this by adding a newline before the closing } of every footnote.

  * HTML writer:
    + Removed incorrect "{}" around style information in HTML tables.
      Column widths now work properly in HTML.
    + If --strict option is specified (and --toc is not), don't include
      identifiers in headers, for better Markdown compatibility.

  * Build process:

    + Separated $(web_dest) and website targets.
    + In website, index.txt is now constructed from template index.txt.in.
    + Added freebsd target to Markefile. This creates the freebsd Makefile
      from Makefile.in, and creates distinfo.  Removed Makefile and distinfo
      from the repository.
    + Added macport target to Makefile. Portfile is built from template
      Portfile.in.
    + Removed OSX package targets.  (Too many difficulties involving
      dependencies on dynamic libraries.)
    + More complete INSTALL instructions for all architectures.

  * Website:
    + Added a programming demo, pandocwiki.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Do not forget to close pandoc's ITP.  Closes: #391666

pandoc (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Fixed bugs in HTML reader:
    + Skip material at end *only if* </html> is present (previously,
      only part of the document would be parsed if an error was
      found; now a proper error message is given).
    + Added new constant eitherBlockOrInline with elements that may
      count either as block-level or as inline. Modified isInline and
      isBlock to take this into account.
    + Modified rawHtmlBlock to accept any tag (even an inline tag):
      this is innocuous, because rawHtmlBlock is tried only if a regular
      inline element can't be parsed.
    + Added a necessary 'try' in definition of 'para'.

  * Fixed bug in markdown ordered list parsing.  The problem was that
    anyOrderedListStart did not check for a space following the
    ordered list marker.  So in 'A.B. 2007' the parser would be
    expecting a list item, but would not find one, causing an error.
    Fixed a similar bug in the RST reader.  Resolves Issue #22.

  * Refactored RST and Markdown readers using parseFromString.

  * LaTeX reader will now skip anything after \end{document}.

  * Fixed blockquote output in markdown writer: previously, block
    quotes in indented contexts would be indented only in the first
    line.

  * Added note to INSTALL about variations in versions of the xhtml
    library that can lead to failed tests (thanks to Leif LeBaron).

pandoc (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Added two new output formats: groff man pages and ConTeXt. By
    default, output files with extensions ".ctx" and ".context" are
    assumed to be ConTeXt, and output files with single-digit extensions
    are assumed to be man pages.

  * Enhanced ordered lists (documented in README, under Lists):
    + The OrderedList block element now stores information about
      list number style, list number delimiter, and starting number.
    + The readers parse this information when possible.
    + The writers use this information to style ordered lists.
    + The enhancement can be disabled using the --strict option.

  * Added support for tables (with a new Table block element). Two kinds
    of tables are supported: a simple table with one-line rows, and a
    more complex variety with multiline rows. All output formats are
    supported, but only markdown tables are parsed at the moment. The
    syntax is documented in README.

  * Added support for definition lists (with a new DefinitionList block
    element). All output and input formats are supported. The syntax is
    documented in README.

  * Added support for superscripts and subscripts (with new Superscript
    and Subscript inline elements).  All input and output
    formats.  The syntax is documented in README.

  * Added support for strikeout (with a new Strikeout inline element).
    All input and output formats are supported. Thanks to Bradley Kuhn,
    who contributed a patch. The syntax is documented in README. Resolves
    Issue #18.

  * Added a --toc|--table-of-contents option.  This causes an automatically
    generated table of contents (or an instruction that creates one) to
    be inserted at the beginning of the document. Not supported in S5,
    DocBook, or man page writers.

  * Modified the -m|--asciimathml option:

    + If an optional URL argument is provided, a link is inserted
      instead of the contents of the ASCIIMathML.js script.
    + Nothing is inserted unless the document actually contains
      LaTeX math.

  * Removed Blank block element as unnecessary.

  * Removed Key and Note blocks from the Pandoc data structure. All
    links are now stored as explicit links, and note contents are
    stored with the (inline) notes.

    + All link Targets are now explicit (URL, title) pairs; there
      is no longer a 'Ref' target.
    + Markdown and RST parsers now need to extract data from key and
      note blocks and insert them into the relevant inline elements.
      Other parsers have been simplified, since there is no longer any need
      to construct separate key and note blocks.
    + Markdown, RST, and HTML writers need to construct lists of
      notes; Markdown and RST writers need to construct lists of link
      references (when the --reference-links option is specified); and
      the RST writer needs to construct a list of image substitution
      references. All writers have been rewritten to use the State monad
      when state is required.
    + Several functions (generateReference, keyTable,
      replaceReferenceLinks, replaceRefLinksBlockList, and some auxiliaries
      used by them) have been removed from Text.Pandoc.Shared, since
      they are no longer needed. New functions and data structures
      (Reference, isNoteBlock, isKeyBlock, isLineClump) have been
      added. The functions inTags, selfClosingTag, inTagsSimple, and
      inTagsIndented have been moved to the DocBook writer, since that
      is now the only module that uses them. NoteTable is now exported
      in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Added stateKeys and stateNotes to ParserState; removed stateKeyBlocks,
      stateKeysUsed, stateNoteBlocks, stateNoteIdentifiers, stateInlineLinks.
    + Added writerNotes and writerReferenceLinks to WriterOptions.

  * Added Text.Pandoc module that exports basic readers, writers,
    definitions, and utility functions. This should export everything
    needed for most uses of Pandoc libraries. The haddock documentation
    includes a short example program.

  * Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML is no longer an exported module.

  * Added Text.Pandoc.Blocks module to help in printing markdown
    and RST tables.  This module provides functions for working with
    fixed-width blocks of text--e.g., placing them side by side, as
    in a table row.

  * Refactored to avoid reliance on Haskell's Text.Regex library, which
    (a) is slow, and (b) does not properly handle unicode.  This fixed
    some strange bugs, e.g. in parsing S-cedilla, and improved performance.

    + Replaced 'gsub' with a general list function  'substitute'
      that does not rely on Text.Regex.
    + Rewrote extractTagType in HTML reader so that it doesn't use
      regexs.
    + In Markdown reader, replaced email regex test with a custom email
      autolink parser (autoLinkEmail). Also replaced selfClosingTag regex
      with a custom function isSelfClosingTag.
    + Modified Docbook writer so that it doesn't rely on Text.Regex for
      detecting 'mailto' links.
    + Removed escapePreservingRegex and reamped entity-handling
      functions in Text.Pandoc.Shared and Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences to
      avoid reliance on Text.Regex (see below on character reference
      handling changes).

  * Renamed Text.Pandoc.Entities as Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences.

  * Changed handling of XML entities.  Entities are now parsed (and unicode
    characters returned) in the Markdown and HTML readers, rather than being
    handled in the writers.  In HTML and Docbook writers, UTF-8 is now used
    instead of entities for characters above 128.  This makes the HTML and
    DocBook output much more readable and more easily editable.

    + Removed sgmlHexEntity, sgmlDecimalEntity, sgmlNamedEntity, and
      sgmlCharacterEntity regexes from Text.Pandoc.Shared.
    + Renamed escapeSGMLChar to escapeCharForXML.  Added escapeStringForXML.
      Moved both functions to Text.Pandoc.Writers.Docbook.
    + Added characterReference parser to Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences.
      This parses a string and return a unicode character.
    + Rewrote decodeCharacterReferences to use the new parser instead of
      Text.Regex.
    + Added new charRef parser for Markdown and HTML, which replaces the
      old 'entity' parser. Added '&' as a special character in Markdown reader.
    + Modified HTML and Markdown readers to call decodeEntities on all raw
      strings (e.g. authors, dates, link titles), to ensure that no
      unprocessed entities are included in the native representation of
      the document.  (In the HTML reader, most of this work is done by a
      change in extractAttributeName.)
    + In XML and Markdown output, escape unicode nonbreaking space as '&nbsp;',
      since a unicode non-breaking space is impossible to distinguish visually
      from a regular space.  (Resolves Issue #3.)
    + Removed encodeEntitiesNumerical.
    + Use Data.Map for entityTable and (new) reverseEntityTable, for a
      slight performance boost over the old association list.
    + Removed unneeded decodeEntities from 'str' parser in HTML and
      Markdown readers.

  * Text.Pandoc.UTF8:  Renamed encodeUTF8 to toUTF8, decodeUTF8 to
    fromUTF8, for clarity.

  * Replaced old haskell98 module names replaced by hierarchical module
    names, e.g. List by Data.List.  Removed haskell98 from dependencies
    in pandoc.cabal, and added mtl (needed for state monad). Substituted
    xhtml for html.

  * Refactored and cleaned up character escaping in writers, using
    backslashEscapes and escapeStringUsing functions.

  * Instead of adding "\n\n" to the end of an input string in Main.hs,
    this is now done in the readers. This makes the libraries behave
    the way you'd expect from the pandoc program. Resolves Issue #10.

  * URLs and email addresses in autolinks are now typeset as Code.

  * In Main.hs, changed putStr to putStrLn -- mainly because MacOS X
    doesn't display the whole output unless there's a line ending.

  * Major code cleanup in all modules, for greater consistency, concision,
    and readability.

  * HTML reader:

    + Fixed several bugs (extractTagType, attribute parsing).
    + Remove Null blocks in lists of blocks when possible.
    + Allow HTML comments as raw HTML inline.

  * Markdown reader:

    + Ordered list items may no longer begin with uppercase letters, or
      letters greater than 'n'.  (This prevents first initials and page
      reference, e.g. 'p. 400', from being parsed as beginning lists.)
      Also, numbers beginning list items may no longer end with ')',
      which is now allowed only after letters.  Note: These changes
      may cause documents to be parsed differently. Users should take
      care in upgrading.
    + Changed autoLink parsing to conform better to Markdown.pl's
      behavior. <google.com> is not treated as a link, but
      <http://google.com>, <ftp://google.com>, and <mailto:google@google.com>
      are.
    + Cleaned up handling of embedded quotes in link titles.  Now these are
      stored as a '"' character, not as '&quot;'.
    + Use lookAhead parser for the 'first pass' (looking for reference keys),
      instead of parsing normally, then using setInput to reset input.  This
      yields a slight performance boost.
    + Fixed several bugs in smart quote recognition.
    + Fixed bug in indentSpaces (which didn't properly handle
      cases with mixed spaces and tabs).
    + Consolidated 'text', 'special', and 'inline' into 'inline'.
    + Fixed bug which allowed URL and title to be separated by multiple blank
      lines in links and reference keys.  They can be on separate lines but
      can't have blank lines between them.
    + Correctly handle bracketed text inside inline footnotes and links,using
      new function inlinesInBalanced.  Resolves Issue #14.
    + Fixed bug in footnotes: links in footnotes were not being
      processed. Solution: three-stage parse. First, get all the
      reference keys and add information to state. Next, get all the
      notes and add information to state. (Reference keys may be needed
      at this stage.) Finally, parse everything else.
    + Replaced named constants like 'emphStart' with literals.
    + Removed an extra occurance of escapedChar in definition of inline.

  * RST reader:

    + Allow the URI in a RST hyperlink target to start on the line
      after the reference key.
    + Added 'try' in front of 'string', where needed, or used a different
      parser.  This fixes a bug where ````` would not be correctly parsed as
      a verbatim `.
    + Fixed slow performance in parsing inline literals in RST reader.  The
      problem was that ``#`` was seen by 'inline' as a potential link or image.
      Fix:  inserted 'notFollowedBy (char '`')' in link parsers.
      Resolves Issue #8.
    + Use lookAhead instead of getInput/setInput in RST reader.  Removed
      unneeded getState call, since lookAhead automatically saves and
      restores the parser state.
    + Allow hyperlink target URIs to be split over multiple lines, and
      to start on the line after the reference. Resolves Issue #7.
    + Fixed handling of autolinks.

  * LaTeX reader:

    + Replaced 'choice [(try (string ...), ...]' idiom with 'oneOfStrings',
      for clarity.
    + Added clauses for tilde and caret. Tilde is \ensuremath{\sim}, and
      caret is \^{}, not \^ as before.
    + Added parsing for \url.
    + Parse \texttt{} as code, provided there's nothing fancy inside.

  * HTML writer:

    + Modified HTML writer to use the Text.XHtml library. This results
      in cleaner, faster code, and it makes it easier to use Pandoc in
      other projects, like wikis, which use Text.XHtml. Two functions are
      now provided, writeHtml and writeHtmlString: the former outputs an
      Html structure, the latter a rendered string. The S5 writer is also
      changed, in parallel ways (writeS5, writeS5String).
    + The Html header is now written programmatically, so it has been
      removed from the 'headers' directory. The S5 header is still
      needed, but the doctype and some of the meta declarations have
      been removed, since they are written programatically. This change
      introduces a new dependency on the xhtml package.
    + Fixed two bugs in email obfuscation involving improper escaping
      of '&' in the <noscript> section and in --strict mode. Resolves
      Issue #9.
    + Fixed another bug in email obfuscation: If the text to be obfuscated
      contains an entity, this needs to be decoded before obfuscation.
      Thanks to thsutton for the patch. Resolves Issue #15.
    + Changed the way the backlink is displayed in HTML footnotes.
      Instead of appearing on a line by itself, it now generally
      appears on the last line of the note.  (Exception:  when the
      note does not end with a Plain or Para block.) This saves space
      and looks better.
    + Added automatic unique identifiers to headers:
      - The identifier is derived from the header via a scheme
        documented in README.
      - WriterState now includes a list of header identifiers and a table
        of contents in addition to notes.
      - The function uniqueIdentifiers creates a list of unique identifiers
        from a list of inline lists (e.g. headers).
      - This list is part of WriterState and gets consumed by blockToHtml
        each time a header is encountered.
    + Include CSS for .strikethrough class in header only if strikethrough
      text appears in the document.
    + If the 'strict' option is specified, elements that do not appear in
      standard markdown (like definition lists) are passed through as
      raw HTML.
    + Simplified treatment of autolinks, using pattern matching instead of
      conditionals.

  * Markdown writer:

    + Links in markdown output are now printed as inline links by default,
      rather than reference links.  A --reference-links option has been added
      that forces links to be printed as reference links.  Resolves Issue #4.
    + Use autolinks when possible.  Instead of [site.com](site.com),
      use <site.com>.

  * LaTeX writer:

    + Rewrote to use the State monad. The preamble now includes only those
      packages that are actually required, given the document's content.
      Thus, for example, if strikeout is not used, ulem is not required.
      Modified LaTeXHeader accordingly.
    + Modified LaTeX writer to insert '\,' between consecutive quotes.
    + Removed unused function tableRowColumnWidths.
    + Simplified code for escaping special characters.
    + Leave extra blank line after \maketitle.
    + Include empty '\author{}' when no author specified to avoid LaTeX
      errors.
    + Include fancyvrb code in header only if needed -- that is, only
      if there is actually code in a footnote.
    + Use \url{} for autolinks.
    + Include [mathletters] option in ucs package, so that basic unicode
      Greek letters will work correctly.

  * RST writer:  Force blank line before lists, so that sublists will
    be handled correctly.

  * Docbook writer:  Fixed a bug:  email links with text, like
    [foo](me@bar.baz), were being incorrectly treated as autolinks.

  * Removed Text.ParserCombinators.Pandoc and moved all its functions to
    Text.Pandoc.Shared.

  * Text.Pandoc.Shared:

    + Added defaultWriterOptions.
    + Added writerTableOfContents to WriterOptions.
    + Added writerIgnoreNotes option to WriterOptions.  This is needed
      for processing header blocks for a table of contents, since notes on
      headers should not appear in the TOC.
    + Added prettyprinting for native Table format.
    + Removed some unneeded imports.
    + Moved escape and nullBlock parsers from
      Text.ParserCombinators.Pandoc, since the latter is for
      general-purpose parsers that don't depend on Text.Pandoc.Definition.
    + Moved isHeaderBlock from Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML.
    + Moved Element, headerAtLeast, and hierarchicalize from Docbook
      writer, because HTML writer now uses these in constructing a table
      of contents.
    + Added clauses for new inline elements (Strikeout, Superscript,
      Subscript) to refsMatch.
    + Removed backslashEscape; added new functions escapeStringUsing and
      backslashEscapes.
    + Moved failIfStrict from markdown reader, since it is now used also
      by the HTML reader.
    + Added a 'try' to the definition of indentSpaces.
    + In definition of 'reference', added check to make sure it's not a note
      reference.
    + Added functions: camelCaseToHyphenated, toRomanNumeral,
      anyOrderedListMarker, orderedListmarker, orderedListMarkers,
      charsInBalanced', withHorizDisplacement, romanNumeral
    + Fixed a bug in the anyLine parser. Previously it would parse an empty
      string "", but it should fail on an empty string, or we get an error
      when it is used inside "many" combinators.
    + Removed followedBy' parser, replacing it with the lookAhead parser from
      Parsec.
    + Added some needed 'try's before multicharacter parsers, especially in
      'option' contexts.
    + Removed the 'try' from the 'end' parser in 'enclosed', so that
      'enclosed' behaves like 'option', 'manyTill', etc.
    + Added lineClump parser, which parses a raw line block up to and
      including any following blank lines.
    + Renamed parseFromStr to parseFromString.
    + Added a 'try' to the 'end' parser in 'enclosed'.  This makes errors in
      the use of 'enclosed' less likely. Removed some now-unnecessary 'try's
      in calling code.
    + Removed unneeded 'try' in blanklines.
    + Removed endsWith function and rewrote calling functions to use
      isSuffixOf instead.
    + Added >>~ combinator.
    + Fixed bug in normalizeSpaces:  Space:Str "":Space should compress to
      Space.

  * Refactored runtests.pl; added separate tests for tables.

  * Shell scripts:

    + Added -asxhtml flag to tidy in html2markdown. This will
      perhaps help the parser, which expects closing tags.
    + Modified markdown2pdf to run pdflatex a second time if --toc or
      --table-of-contents was specified; otherwise the table of
      contents won't appear.
    + Modified markdown2pdf to print a helpful message if the 'ulem'
      LaTeX package is required and not found.

  * Changes to build process:

    + Dropped support for compilation with GHC 6.4.  GHC 6.6 or higher
      is now required.
    + Removed cabalize and Pandoc.cabal.in. The repository now contains
      pandoc.cabal itself.
    + Pandoc.cabal has been changed to pandoc.cabal, because HackageDB
      likes the cabal file to have the same name as the tarball.
    + Expanded and revised the package description in pandoc.cabal.
      Revised the package synopsis.
    + The tarball built by 'make tarball' now contains files built from
      templates (including man pages and shell scripts), so pandoc can
      be built directly using Cabal tools, without preprocessing.
    + Executable binaries are now stripped before installing.
    + Man pages are now generated from markdown sources, using pandoc's
      man page writer.
    + Use HTML version of README (instead of RTF) in Mac OS X installer.
    + Instead of testing for the existence of a pandoc symlink in build-exec,
      use ln -f.

  * Documentation:

    + Updated README and man pages with information on new features.
    + Updated INSTALL instructions with some useful clarifications and
      links.
    + Updated web content.

  * Added FreeBSD port.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * debian/control:

    + Changed pandoc's Build-Depends to include libghc6-mtl-dev and
      libghc6-xhtml-dev.  Removed libghc6-html-dev.
    + Suggest texlive-latex-recommended | tetex-extra instead of
      tetex-bin.  This brings in fancyvrb and unicode support.

pandoc (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John MacFarlane ]

  * Changes in pandoc options:

    + Allow options to follow or precede arguments.
    + Changed '--smartypants' to '--smart' and adjusted symbols accordingly.
    + Added '--strict' option.
    + Added '-o/--output' option.
    + Added '--dump-args' and '--ignore-args' options (for use in wrappers).
    + Modified '-v' and '-h' output to go to STDERR, not STDOUT, and return
      error conditions.  This is helpful for writing wrappers.
    + Added copyright message to '-v' output, modeled after FSF messages.
    + Reformatted usage message so that it doesn't wrap illegibly.
    + Removed extra blanks after '-h' and '-D' output.

  * Added docbook writer.

  * Added implicit setting of default input and output format based
    on input and output filename extensions.  These defaults are
    overridden if explicit input and output formats are specified using
    '-t', '-f', '-r', or '-w' options.  Documented in pandoc(1) man page
    and README.

  * Allow ordered list items to begin with (single) letters, as well
    as numbers.  The list item marker may now be terminated either by
    '.' or by ')'.  This extension to standard markdown is documented
    in README.

  * Revised footnote syntax.  (See README for full details.)  The
    '[^1]' format now standard in markdown extensions is supported,
    as are inline footnotes with this syntax: '^[My note.]'.
    The earlier footnote syntax '^(1)' is no longer supported.

  * Improved HTML representation of footnotes.  All footnotes
    are now auto-numbered and appear in an ordered list at the
    end of the HTML document.  Since the default appearance is now
    acceptable, the old footnote styles have been removed from the
    HTML header.

  * Bug fixes:

    + Fixed a serious bug in the markdown, LaTeX, and RST readers.
      These readers ran 'runParser' on processed chunks of text to handle
      embedded block lists in lists and quotation blocks.  But then
      any changes made to the parser state in these chunks was lost,
      as the state is local to the parser.  So, for example, footnotes
      didn't work in quotes or list items.  The fix:  instead of calling
      runParser on some raw text, use setInput to make it the input, then
      parse it, then use setInput to restore the input to what it was
      before.  This is shorter and more elegant, and it fixes the problem.
    + Fixed bug in notFollowedBy' combinator (adding 'try' before
      'parser').  Adjusted code that uses this combinator accordingly.
    + Fixed bug in RTF writer that caused improper indentation on
      footnotes occurring in indented blocks like lists.
    + Fixed parsing of metadata in LaTeX reader.  Now the title, author,
      and date are parsed correctly.  Everything else in the preamble
      is skipped.
    + Modified escapedChar in LaTeX reader to allow a '\' at the end of a
      line to count as escaped whitespace.
    + Modified LaTeX reader to produce inline links rather than reference
      links.  Otherwise, links in footnotes aren't handled properly.
    + Fixed handling of titles in links in Markdown reader, so that
      embedded quotation marks are now handled properly.
    + Fixed Markdown reader's handling of embedded brackets in links.
    + Fixed Markdown reader so that it only parses bracketed material
      as a reference link if there is actually a corresponding key.
    + Revised inline code parsing in Markdown reader to conform to
      markdown standard.  Now any number of `s can begin inline code,
      which will end with the same number of `s.  For example, to
      have two backticks as code, write ``` `` ```.  Modified Markdown
      writer accordingly.
    + Fixed bug in text-wrapping routine in Markdown and RST writers.
      Now LineBreaks no longer cause wrapping problems.
    + Supported hexadecimal numerical entity references as well as
      decimal ones.
    + Fixed bug in Markdown reader's handling of underscores and other
      inline formatting markers inside reference labels:  for example,
      in '[A_B]: /url/a_b', the material between underscores was being
      parsed as emphasized inlines.
    + Changed Markdown reader's handling of backslash escapes so that
      only non-alphanumeric characters can be escaped.  Strict mode
      follows Markdown.pl in only allowing a select group of punctuation
      characters to be escaped.
    + Modified HTML reader to skip a newline following a <br> tag.
      Otherwise the newline will be treated as a space at the beginning
      of the next line.

  * Made handling of code blocks more consistent.  Previously, some
    readers allowed trailing newlines, while others stripped them.
    Now, all readers strip trailing newlines in code blocks. Writers
    insert a newline at the end of code blocks as needed.

  * Modified readers to make spacing at the end of output more consistent.

  * Minor improvements to LaTeX reader:

    + '\thanks' now treated like a footnote.
    + Simplified parsing of LaTeX command arguments and options.
      commandArgs now returns a list of arguments OR options (in
      whatever order they appear).  The brackets are included, and
      a new stripFirstAndLast function is provided to strip them off
      when needed.  This fixes a problem in dealing with \newcommand
      and \newenvironment.

  * Revised RTF writer:

    + Default font is now Helvetica.
    + An '\f0' is added to each '\pard', so that font resizing works
      correctly.

  * Moved handling of "smart typography" from the writers to the Markdown
    and LaTeX readers.  This allows great simplification of the writers
    and more accurate smart quotes, dashes, and ellipses.  DocBook can
    now use '<quote>'.  The '--smart' option now toggles an option in
    the parser state rather than a writer option.  Several new kinds
    of inline elements have been added: Quoted, Ellipses, Apostrophe,
    EmDash, EnDash.

  * Changes in HTML writer:

    + Include title block in header even when title is null.
    + Made javascript obfuscation of emails even more obfuscatory,
      by combining it with entity obfuscation.

  * Changed default ASCIIMathML text color to black.

  * Test suite:

    + Added --strip-trailing-cr option to diff in runtests.pl, for
      compatibility with Windows.
    + Added regression tests with footnotes in quote blocks and lists.

  * Makefile changes:

    + osx-pkg target creates a Mac OS X package (directory). New osx
      directory contains files needed for construction of the package.
    + osx-dmg target creates a compressed disk image containing the package.
    + win-pkg target creates Windows binary package.
    + tarball target creates distribution source tarball.
    + website target generates pandoc's website automatically, including
      demos.  New 'web' directory containts files needed for construction
      of the website (which will be created as the 'pandoc' subdirectory
      of 'web').
    + Makefile checks to see if we're running Windows/Cygwin; if so,
      a '.exe' extension is added to each executable in EXECS.

  * Removed all wrappers except markdown2pdf and html2markdown.

  * Added new wrapper hsmarkdown, to be used as a drop-in replacement
    for Markdown.pl.  hsmarkdown calls pandoc with the '--strict'
    option and disables other options.

  * Added code to html2markdown that tries to determine the character
    encoding of an HTML file, by parsing the "Content-type" meta tag.

    + If the encoding can't be determined, then if the content is local,
      the local encoding is used; if it comes from a URL, UTF-8 is used
      by default.
    + If input is from STDIN, don't try to determine character encoding.
    + Encoding can be specified explicitly using '-e' option.

  * Improved warning messages in wrappers:

    + Print warning if iconv not available
    + More user-friendly error messages in markdown2pdf, when
      pdflatex fails.

  * Code cleanup:

    + Renamed 'Text/Pandoc/HtmlEntities' module to
      'Text/Pandoc/Entities'. Also changed function names so as
      not to be HTML-specific.
    + Refactored SGML string escaping functions from HTML and Docbook
      writers into Text/Pandoc/Shared.  (escapeSGML, stringToSGML)
    + Removed 'BlockQuoteContext' from ParserContext, as it isn't
      used anywhere.
    + Removed splitBySpace and replaced it with a general, polymorphic
      splitBy function.
    + Refactored LaTeX reader for clarity (added isArg function).
    + Converted some CR's to LF's in src/ui/default/print.css.
    + Added license text to top of source files.
    + Added module data for haddock to source files.
    + Reformatted code for consistency.

  * Rewrote documentation and man pages.  Split README into INSTALL
    and README.

  * Split LICENSE into COPYING and COPYRIGHT.

  * Removed TODO, since we now maintain ToDo on the wiki.

  * Made COPYRIGHT in top level a symlink to debian/copyright, to avoid
    duplication.

  [ Recai Oktaş ]

  * Revamped build process to conform to debian standards and created
    a proper debian package.  Closes: #391666.

  * Modified build process to support GHC 6.6.

    + The package can still be compiled using GHC 6.4.2, though because
      of dependencies the "make deb" target works only with GHC 6.6+.
    + The script 'cabalize' is used to create an appropriate
      'Pandoc.cabal' from 'Pandoc.cabal.in', depending on the GHC and
      Cabal versions.

  * Refactored template processing (fillTemplates.pl).

  * Modified wrapper scripts to make them more robust and portable.
    To avoid code duplication and ensure consistency, wrappers are
    generated via a templating system from templates in src/wrappers.

    + Wrappers now accept multiple filenames, when appropriate.
    + Spaces and tabs allowed in filenames.
    + getopts shell builtin is used for portable option parsing.
    + Improved html2markdown's web grabber code, making it more robust,
      configurable and verbose.  Added '-e', '-g' options.
