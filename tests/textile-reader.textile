This is a set of tests for pandoc Textile Reader. Part of it comes
from John Gruber's markdown test suite.

-----

h1. Headers

h2. Level 2 with an "embeded link":http://www.example.com

h3. Level 3 with *emphasis*

h4. Level 4

h5. Level 5

h6. Level 6


h1. Paragraphs

Here's a regular paragraph.

Line breaks are preserved in textile, so you can not wrap your very
long paragraph with your favourite text editor and have it rendered
with no break.


Here's one with a bullet.

* criminey.

There should be a paragraph break between here

and here.

pandoc converts textile.

h1. Block Quotes

bq. This is a famous quote from somebody. He had a lot of things to
say, so the text is really really long and spans on multiple lines.

And a following paragraph.

h1. Code Blocks

Code:

<pre>
    ---- (should be four hyphens)

    sub status {
        print "working";
    }

	this code block is indented by one tab
</pre>

And:

<pre>
		this code block is indented by two tabs

    These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
</pre>

        continued
    @</\

h1. Inline Markup

This is _emphasized_, and so __is this__.
This is *strong*, and so **is this**.
A "*strong link*":http://www.foobar.com.

_*This is strong and em.*_
So is *_this_* word and __**that one**__.
-This is strikeout and *strong*-

Superscripts:  a^bc^d a^*hello*^ a^hello there^.
Subscripts: H~2~O, H~23~O, H~many of them~O.

Dashes : How cool -- automatic dashes.

Elipses : He thought and thought ... and then thought some more.

Quotes and apostrophes : "I'd like to thank you" for example.


h1. Links

h2. Explicit

Just a "url":http://www.url.com

"Email link":mailto:nobody@nowhere.net

Automatic linking to http://www.example.com and foobar@example.com.

"Example":http://www.example.com/: Example of a link followed by a colon.

h1. Tables

Textile allows tables with and without headers :

h2. Without headers

| name   | age | sex |
| joan   | 24  | f   |
| archie | 29  | m   |
| bella  | 45  | f   |

and some text following ...

h2. With headers

|_. name |_. age |_. sex |
| joan   | 24    | f     |
| archie | 29    | m     |
| bella  | 45    | f     |



h1. Images

Textile inline image syntax, like 
here !this_is_an_image.png(this is the alt text)!
and here !this_is_an_image.png!.

h1. Attributes

h2{color:red}. HTML and CSS attributes are ignored

as well as *(foo)inline attributes* of %{color:red} all kind%

p{color:green}. and paragraph attributes, and table attributes.

table{foo:bar}.
| name   | age | sex |
| joan   | 24  | f   |

h1. Raw HTML

However, <strong> raw HTML inlines </strong> are accepted, as well as :

<div class="foobar">
  any *Raw HTML Block* with bold
</div>

Html blocks can be <div>inlined</div> as well. 

* this <div> won't produce raw html blocks </div>
* but this <strong> will produce inline html </strong>

Can you prove that 2 < 3 ?
