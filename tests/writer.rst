This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from John Gruber’s
markdown test suite.

--------------

Headers
=======

Level 2 with an `embedded link </url>`_
---------------------------------------

Level 3 with *emphasis*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Level 4
^^^^^^^

Level 5
'''''''

Level 1
=======

Level 2 with *emphasis*
-----------------------

Level 3
~~~~~~~

with no blank line

Level 2
-------

with no blank line

--------------

Paragraphs
==========

Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version 8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the middle of a paragraph looked like a list
item.

Here’s one with a bullet. \* criminey.

There should be a hard line break
here.

--------------

Block Quotes
============

E-mail style:

    This is a block quote. It is pretty short.

    Code in a block quote:

    ::

        sub status {
            print "working";
        }

    A list:

    1. item one
    2. item two

    Nested block quotes:

        nested

        nested

This should not be a block quote: 2 > 1.

And a following paragraph.

--------------

Code Blocks
===========

Code:

::

    ---- (should be four hyphens)

    sub status {
        print "working";
    }

    this code block is indented by one tab

And:

::

        this code block is indented by two tabs

    These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{

HTML Blocks
===========

Simple block on one line:

.. raw:: html

   <div>

foo

.. raw:: html

   </div>

And nested without indentation:

.. raw:: html

   <div>
   <div>
   <div>

foo

.. raw:: html

   </div>
   </div>
   <div>

bar

.. raw:: html

   </div>
   </div>

Interpreted markdown in a table:

.. raw:: html

   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>

This is *emphasized*

.. raw:: html

   </td>
   <td>

And this is **strong**

.. raw:: html

   </td>
   </tr>
   </table>

   <script type="text/javascript">document.write('This *should not* be interpreted as markdown');</script>

Here’s a simple block:

.. raw:: html

   <div>
       

foo

.. raw:: html

   </div>

This should be a code block, though:

::

    <div>
        foo
    </div>

As should this:

::

    <div>foo</div>

Now, nested:

.. raw:: html

   <div>
       <div>
           <div>
               

foo

.. raw:: html

   </div>
       </div>
   </div>

This should just be an HTML comment:

.. raw:: html

   <!-- Comment -->

Multiline:

.. raw:: html

   <!--
   Blah
   Blah
   -->

   <!--
       This is another comment.
   -->

Code block:

::

    <!-- Comment -->

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

.. raw:: html

   <!-- foo -->   

Code:

::

    <hr />

Hr’s:

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

   <hr />

   <hr />

   <hr>   

   <hr />  

   <hr /> 

   <hr class="foo" id="bar" />

   <hr class="foo" id="bar" />

   <hr class="foo" id="bar">

--------------

Inline Markup
=============

This is *emphasized*, and so *is this*.

This is **strong**, and so **is this**.

An *`emphasized link </url>`_*.

***This is strong and em.***

So is ***this*** word.

***This is strong and em.***

So is ***this*** word.

This is code: ``>``, ``$``, ``\``, ``\$``, ``<html>``.

[STRIKEOUT:This is *strikeout*.]

Superscripts: a\ :sup:`bc`\ d a\ :sup:`*hello*`\  a\ :sup:`hello there`\ .

Subscripts: H\ :sub:`2`\ O, H\ :sub:`23`\ O, H\ :sub:`many of them`\ O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped
spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

--------------

Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes
==============================

“Hello,” said the spider. “‘Shelob’ is my name.”

‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ are letters.

‘Oak,’ ‘elm,’ and ‘beech’ are names of trees. So is ‘pine.’

‘He said, “I want to go.”’ Were you alive in the 70’s?

Here is some quoted ‘``code``’ and a “`quoted
link <http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2>`_”.

Some dashes: one—two — three—four — five.

Dashes between numbers: 5–7, 255–66, 1987–1999.

Ellipses…and…and….

LaTeX
=====

-  
-  :math:`$2+2=4$`
-  :math:`$x \in y$`
-  :math:`$\alpha \wedge \omega$`
-  :math:`$223$`
-  :math:`$p$`-Tree
-  Here’s some display math:
   :math:`$$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$`
-  Here’s one that has a line break in it:
   :math:`$\alpha + \omega \times x^2$`.

These shouldn’t be math:

-  To get the famous equation, write ``$e = mc^2$``.
-  $22,000 is a *lot* of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if “lot” is
   emphasized.)
-  Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
-  Escaped ``$``: $73 *this should be emphasized* 23$.

Here’s a LaTeX table:

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
   Animal & Number \\ \hline
   Dog    & 2      \\
   Cat    & 1      \\ \hline
   \end{tabular}

--------------

==================

Here is some unicode:

-  I hat: Î
-  o umlaut: ö
-  section: §
-  set membership: ∈
-  copyright: ©

AT&T has an ampersand in their name.

AT&T is another way to write it.

This & that.

4 < 5.

6 > 5.

Backslash: \\

Backtick: \`

Asterisk: \*

Underscore: \_

Left brace: {

Right brace: }

Left bracket: [

Right bracket: ]

Left paren: (

Right paren: )

Greater-than: >

Hash: #

Period: .

Bang: !

Plus: +

Minus: -

--------------

Reference
---------

Foo `bar </url/>`_.

Foo `bar </url/>`_.

Foo `bar </url/>`_.

With `embedded [brackets] </url/>`_.

`b </url/>`_ by itself should be a link.

Indented `once </url>`_.

Indented `twice </url>`_.

Indented `thrice </url>`_.

This should [not][] be a link.

::

    [not]: /url

Foo `bar </url/>`_.

Foo `biz </url/>`_.

With ampersands
---------------

Here’s a `link with an ampersand in the
URL <http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2>`_.

Here’s a link with an amersand in the link text: `AT&T <http://att.com/>`_.

Here’s an `inline link </script?foo=1&bar=2>`_.

Here’s an `inline link in pointy braces </script?foo=1&bar=2>`_.

Autolinks
---------

With an ampersand: http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2

-  In a list?
-  http://example.com/
-  It should.

An e-mail address: nobody@nowhere.net

    Blockquoted: http://example.com/

Auto-links should not occur here: ``<http://example.com/>``

::

    or here: <http://example.com/>

Images
======

From “Voyage dans la Lune” by Georges Melies (1902):

.. figure:: lalune.jpg
   :align: center
   :alt: Voyage dans la Lune

   lalune
Here is a movie |movie| icon.

--------------

Footnotes
=========

Here is a footnote reference, [1]_ and another. [2]_ This should *not* be a
footnote reference, because it contains a space.[^my note] Here is an inline
note. [3]_

    Notes can go in quotes. [4]_

1. And in list items. [5]_

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

.. [1]
   Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere after the footnote reference. It
   need not be placed at the end of the document.

.. [2]
   Here’s the long note. This one contains multiple blocks.

   Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the footnote (as
   with list items).

   ::

         { <code> }

   If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be lazy and just
   indent the first line of each block.

.. [3]
   This is *easier* to type. Inline notes may contain
   `links <http://google.com>`_ and ``]`` verbatim characters, as well as
   [bracketed text].

.. [4]
   In quote.

.. [5]
   In list.
