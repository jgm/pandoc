This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from John Gruber’s markdown test suite.


----

====== Headers ======

===== Level 2 with an embedded link =====

==== Level 3 with emphasis ====

=== Level 4 ===

== Level 5 ==

====== Level 1 ======

===== Level 2 with emphasis =====

==== Level 3 ====

with no blank line

===== Level 2 =====

with no blank line


----

====== Paragraphs ======

Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version 8. This line turns into a list item. Because a hard-wrapped line in the middle of a paragraph looked like a list item.

Here’s one with a bullet. * criminey.

There should be a hard line break
here.


----

====== Block Quotes ======

E-mail style:

> This is a block quote. It is pretty short.

> Code in a block quote:
> 
> '''
> sub status {
>     print "working";
> }
> '''
> 
> A list:
> 
> 	1. item one
> 	1. item two
> 
> Nested block quotes:
> 
> > nested
> 
> > nested

This should not be a block quote: 2 > 1.

And a following paragraph.


----

====== Code Blocks ======

Code:

'''
---- (should be four hyphens)

sub status {
    print "working";
}

this code block is indented by one tab
'''

And:

'''
    this code block is indented by two tabs

These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
'''

computer

* **orange** orange fruit
bank

Blank line after term, indented marker, alternate markers:

* **apple** red fruit
computer

* **orange** orange fruit

	1. sublist
	1. sublist

====== HTML Blocks ======

Simple block on one line:

foo

And nested without indentation:

foo



bar


Interpreted markdown in a table:




This is //emphasized//


And this is **strong**




Here’s a simple block:

foo


This should be a code block, though:

'''
<div>
    foo
</div>
'''

As should this:

'''
<div>foo</div>
'''

Now, nested:

foo



This should just be an HTML comment:


Multiline:



Code block:

'''
<!-- Comment -->
'''

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:


Code:

'''
<hr />
'''

Hr’s:











----

====== Inline Markup ======

This is //emphasized//, and so //is this//.

This is **strong**, and so **is this**.

An //[[url|emphasized link]]//.

**//This is strong and em.//**

So is **//this//** word.

**//This is strong and em.//**

So is **//this//** word.

This is code: ''>'', ''$'', ''\'', ''\$'', ''<html>''.

~~This is //strikeout//.~~

Superscripts: a^{bc}d a^{//hello//} a^{hello there}.

Subscripts: H_{2}O, H_{23}O, H_{many of them}O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.


----

====== Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes ======

“Hello,” said the spider. “‘Shelob’ is my name.”

‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ are letters.

‘Oak,’ ‘elm,’ and ‘beech’ are names of trees. So is ‘pine.’

‘He said, “I want to go.”’ Were you alive in the 70’s?

Here is some quoted ‘''code''’ and a “[[http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2|quoted link]]”.

Some dashes: one—two — three—four — five.

Dashes between numbers: 5–7, 255–66, 1987–1999.

Ellipses…and…and….


----

====== LaTeX ======

	* 
	* $2+2=4$
	* $x \in y$
	* $\alpha \wedge \omega$
	* $223$
	* $p$-Tree
	* Here’s some display math: $$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
	* Here’s one that has a line break in it: $\alpha + \omega \times x^2$.

These shouldn’t be math:

	* To get the famous equation, write ''$e = mc^2$''.
	* $22,000 is a //lot// of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if “lot” is emphasized.)
	* Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
	* Escaped ''$'': $73 //this should be emphasized// 23$.

Here’s a LaTeX table:



----

====== Special Characters ======

Here is some unicode:

	* I hat: Î
	* o umlaut: ö
	* section: §
	* set membership: ∈
	* copyright: ©

AT&T has an ampersand in their name.

AT&T is another way to write it.

This & that.

With [[url/|embedded [brackets]]].

[[url/|b]] by itself should be a link.

Here’s a [[http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2|link with an ampersand in the URL]].

Here’s a link with an amersand in the link text: [[http://att.com/|AT&T]].

Here’s an [[script?foo=1&bar=2|inline link]].

Here’s an [[script?foo=1&bar=2|inline link in pointy braces]].

===== Autolinks =====

With an ampersand: http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2

	* In a list?
	* http://example.com/
	* It should.

An e-mail address: <nobody@nowhere.net>

> Blockquoted: http://example.com/

Auto-links should not occur here: ''<http://example.com/>''

'''
or here: <http://example.com/>
'''

====== Images ======

From “Voyage dans la Lune” by Georges Melies (1902):

{{:lalune.jpg|Voyage dans la Lune lalune}}

Here is a movie {{:movie.jpg|movie}} icon.


----

====== Footnotes ======

Here is a footnote reference,((Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere after the footnote reference. It need not be placed at the end of the document.
)) and another.((Here’s the long note. This one contains multiple blocks.

Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the footnote (as with list items).

'''
  { <code> }
'''

If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be lazy and just indent the first line of each block.
)) This should //not// be a footnote reference, because it contains a space.[^my note] Here is an inline note.((This is //easier// to type. Inline notes may contain [[http://google.com|links]] and '']'' verbatim characters, as well as [bracketed text].
))

> Notes can go in quotes.((In quote.
> ))

	1. And in list items.((In list.))

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.
