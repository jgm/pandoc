## Lazy referenced links

[*]: http://thisshouldbeignored.com "lazy keys must appear after link"

This is my text and [this is my lazy link][*]. Only link identifier `*`
is recognized as a lazy link. I'll define the url for that link under
the paragraph.

[*]: https://google.com

I can use [multiple][*] lazy links in [a paragraph][*], and then just
define them in order below it.

Lazy link targets can only be defined after [its corresponding link][*]
in the text. The previous url is ignored, while the one below this
paragraph will be used for the link.

Implicit reference key does not work for lazy links, so I cannot write
[*] and expect it to link to a url. This is true only if the `lazy_link`
extension is enabled, otherwise the key `*` has no special meaning.
