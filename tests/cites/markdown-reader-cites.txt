# Try Pandoc with Citeproc-hs

And now some citation. In a note [^1]. Then a citation group: [See
@item1, p. 34-35; also @item3, chap. 3]. Another one: [See
@item1, p. 34-35]. And another one.[^2]. And a textual citation, as 
argued by Doe [-@item1, p. 10; but also @item2, p. 98].

Now some modifiers.[^3]
And some more.[^4]

[^1]:
     A citation without locators: [@item3].

[^2]:
     Some citations: [See @item2, chap. 3; @item3; @item1].

[^3]:
     Like a citation without author: [-@item1], and now Doe with a
     locator [-@item2, p. 44]. And now Author-only: [+@item3].

[^4]:
     As argued by Doe [-@item1, p. 10; but see also @item2, p. 12-14].
