% Installing pandoc

These instructions explain how to install pandoc from source.
Binary packages or ports of pandoc are available for freebsd
and several linux distributions, so check your package manager.
There are also binary installers for Windows and Mac OS X.

If you are installing the development version from github, see also:
https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Installing-the-development-version-of-pandoc

Please note that pandoc only supports [GHC] versions 7.8 and
above. The easiest way to get GHC is by installing the [Haskell platform]

How to get the source
---------------------

Source tarballs can be found at
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc>.  The tarball
for a particular version `VERSION` can be found at

    https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-VERSION/pandoc-VERSION.tar.gz

**Do not use the automatically generated tarball that can be
downloaded from pandoc's GitHub releases page.**  It does not
include some essential template files, which come from a GitHub
submodule.

If you want the latest development code, you can fetch it
by cloning the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jgm/pandoc
    cd pandoc
    git submodule update --init   # to fetch the templates

Note:  there may be times when the development code is broken
or depends on other libraries which must be installed
separately.  Unless you really know what you're doing, install
the last released version.

Quick install with stack
------------------------

1.  Install [stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade.html).

2.  If you used git to get the pandoc source (as opposed to unpacking
    a release tarball), do

        git submodule update --init

3.  In the pandoc source directory,

        stack install

    You may be prompted to run `stack setup`, which will automatically
    download the ghc compiler if needed.


Quick install with cabal
------------------------

1.  Install the [Haskell platform].  This will give you [GHC] and
    the [cabal-install] build tool.

2.  Update your package database:

        cabal update

3.  Use `cabal` to install pandoc and its dependencies:

        cabal install pandoc

    This procedure will install the released version of pandoc,
    which will be downloaded automatically from HackageDB.

    If this step fails, and you are using an older version
    of the Haskell Platform, e.g. on Debian stable, you may need to
    upgrade your version of cabal:

        cabal install cabal-install
        ~/.cabal/bin/cabal update
        ~/.cabal/bin/cabal install pandoc

    If you want to install a modified or development version
    of pandoc instead, switch to the source directory and do
    as above, but without the 'pandoc':

        cabal install

    Note: If you obtained the source from the git repository (rather
    than a release tarball), you'll need to do

        git submodule update --init

    to fetch the contents of `data/templates` before `cabal install`.

4.  Make sure the `$CABALDIR/bin` directory is in your path.  You should
    now be able to run `pandoc`:

        pandoc --help

    [Not sure where `$CABALDIR` is?](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install#The_cabal-install_configuration_file)

5.  If you want to process citations with pandoc, you will also need to
    install a separate package, `pandoc-citeproc`.  This can be installed
    using cabal:

        cabal install pandoc-citeproc

    By default `pandoc-citeproc` uses the "i;unicode-casemap" method
    to sort bibliography entries (RFC 5051).  If you would like to
    use the locale-sensitive unicode collation algorithm instead,
    specify the `unicode_collation` flag:

       cabal install pandoc-citeproc -funicode_collation

    Note that this requires the `text-icu` library, which in turn
    depends on the C library `icu4c`.  Installation directions
    vary by platform.  Here is how it might work on OSX with homebrew:

       brew install icu4c
       cabal install --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/51.1/lib \
         --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/51.1/include \
         -funicode_collation text-icu pandoc-citeproc

The `pandoc.1` man page will be installed automatically.  cabal shows
you where it is installed: you may need to set your `MANPATH`
accordingly. If `MANUAL.txt` has been modified, the man page can be
rebuilt: `make man/pandoc.1`.

The `pandoc-citeproc.1` man page will also be installed automatically.

Custom install
--------------

This is a step-by-step procedure that offers maximal control
over the build and installation.  Most users should use the
quick install, but this information may be of use to packagers.
For more details, see the [Cabal User's Guide].  These instructions
assume that the pandoc source directory is your working directory.

1.  Install dependencies:  in addition to the [Haskell platform],
    you will need a number of additional libraries.  You can install
    them all with

        cabal update
        cabal install --only-dependencies

2.  Configure:

        cabal configure --prefix=DIR --bindir=DIR --libdir=DIR \
          --datadir=DIR --libsubdir=DIR --datasubdir=DIR --docdir=DIR \
          --htmldir=DIR --program-prefix=PREFIX --program-suffix=SUFFIX \
          --mandir=DIR --flags=FLAGSPEC

    All of the options have sensible defaults that can be overridden
    as needed.

    `FLAGSPEC` is a list of Cabal configuration flags, optionally
    preceded by a `-` (to force the flag to `false`), and separated
    by spaces.  Pandoc's flags include:

    - `embed_data_files`: embed all data files into the binary (default no).
      This is helpful if you want to create a relocatable binary.
      Note:  if this option is selected, you need to install the
      `hsb2hs` preprocessor: `cabal install hsb2hs` (version 0.3.1 or
      higher is required).

    - `https`:  enable support for downloading resources over https
      (using the `http-client` and `http-client-tls` libraries).

3.  Build:

        cabal build

4.  Build API documentation:

        cabal haddock --html-location=URL --hyperlink-source

5.  Copy the files:

        cabal copy --destdir=PATH

    The default destdir is `/`.

6.  Register pandoc as a GHC package:

        cabal register

    Package managers may want to use the `--gen-script` option to
    generate a script that can be run to register the package at
    install time.

Creating a relocatable binary
-----------------------------

It is possible to compile pandoc such that the data files
pandoc uses are embedded in the binary.  The resulting binary
can be run from any directory and is completely self-contained.

    cabal install hsb2hs  # a required build tool
    cabal install --flags="embed_data_files" citeproc-hs
    cabal configure --flags="embed_data_files"
    cabal build

You can find the pandoc executable in `dist/build/pandoc`.  Copy this wherever
you please.

Or alternatively with `stack`:

    stack install pandoc --flag pandoc:embed_data_files

Running tests
-------------

Pandoc comes with an automated test suite integrated to cabal.
To build the tests:

    cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal build

To run the tests:

    cabal test

To run particular tests (pattern-matching on their names), use
the `-t` option:

    cabal test --test-options='-t markdown'

If you add a new feature to pandoc, please add tests as well, following
the pattern of the existing tests. The test suite code is in
`tests/test-pandoc.hs`. If you are adding a new reader or writer, it is
probably easiest to add some data files to the `tests` directory, and
modify `tests/Tests/Old.hs`. Otherwise, it is better to modify the module
under the `tests/Tests` hierarchy corresponding to the pandoc module you
are changing.

Running benchmarks
------------------

To build the benchmarks:

    cabal configure --enable-benchmarks && cabal build

To run the benchmarks:

    cabal bench

To use a smaller sample size so the benchmarks run faster:

    cabal bench --benchmark-options='-s 20'

To run just the markdown benchmarks:

    cabal bench --benchmark-options='markdown'
