% Installing pandoc

These instructions explain how to install pandoc from source.
Binary packages or ports of pandoc are available for freebsd
and several linux distributions, so check your package manager.
There is also a Windows installer.

Quick install
-------------

1.  Install the [Haskell platform].  This will give you [GHC] and
the [cabal-install] build tool.

2.  Use `cabal` to install pandoc and its dependencies:

        cabal install pandoc

    This procedure will install the released version of pandoc,
    which will be downloaded automatically from HackageDB.
    If you want to install a modified or development version
    of pandoc instead, switch to the source directory and do
    as above, but without the 'pandoc':

        cabal install

3.  Make sure the `$CABALDIR/bin` directory is in your path.  You should
now be able to run `pandoc`:

        pandoc --help

4.  Make sure the `$CABALDIR/share/man/man1` directory is in your `MANPATH`.
You should now be able to access the `pandoc` man page:

        man pandoc

Custom install
--------------

This is a step-by-step procedure that offers maximal control
over the build and installation.  Most users should use the
quick install, but this information may be of use to packagers.
For more details, see the [Cabal User's Guide].

1.  Install dependencies:  in addition to the [Haskell platform],
you will need [zip-archive], [blaze-html], and [highlighting-kate].

2.  Configure:

        runghc Setup.hs configure --prefix=DIR --bindir=DIR --libdir=DIR \
          --datadir=DIR --libsubdir=DIR --datasubdir=DIR --docdir=DIR \
          --htmldir=DIR --program-prefix=PREFIX --program-suffix=SUFFIX \
          --mandir=DIR --flags=FLAGSPEC

    All of the options have sensible defaults that can be overridden
    as needed.

    `FLAGSPEC` is a list of Cabal configuration flags, optionally
    preceded by a `-` (to force the flag to `false`), and separated
    by spaces.  Pandoc's flags include:

    - `executable`: build the pandoc executable (default yes)
    - `library`: build the pandoc library (default yes)

    So, for example,

        --flags="-executable"

    tells Cabal to build the library but not the executables,
    and to compile with syntax highlighting support.

3.  Build:

        runghc Setup.hs build

4.  Build API documentation:

        runghc Setup.hs haddock --html-location=URL --hyperlink-source

5.  Copy the files:

        runghc Setup.hs copy --destdir=PATH

    The default destdir is `/`.

6.  Register pandoc as a GHC package:

        runghc Setup.hs register

    Package managers may want to use the `--gen-script` option to
    generate a script that can be run to register the package at
    install time.

Creating a relocatable Windows binary
-------------------------------------

On Windows it is possible to compile pandoc such that it
(and its data files) are "relocatable."  You can put the relocatable
binary in any directory (even on a USB drive), and it will look for its
data files there.

    cabal install --flags="embed_data_files" citeproc-hs
    cabal install --flags="executable -library" --datasubdir=

You can find `pandoc.exe` in `dist/build/pandoc`.  Copy this wherever
you please, and copy the following data files to the same place:

    README
    COPYRIGHT
    COPYING
    reference.odt
    reference.docx
    epub.css
    default.csl
    templates/
    data/
    s5/
    slidy/
    dzslides/
    pcre-license.txt
    pcre3.dll

This is essentially what the binary installer does.
