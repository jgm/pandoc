.SH NAME
pandoc - general markup converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]pandoc\f[] [\f[I]options\f[]] [\f[I]input\-file\f[]]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
another, and a command\-line tool that uses this library.
It can read Markdown, CommonMark, and (subsets of) Textile,
reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, Haddock
markup, OPML, Emacs Org\-mode, DocBook, txt2tags, EPUB and Word docx;
and it can write plain text, Markdown, reStructuredText, XHTML, HTML 5,
LaTeX (including beamer slide shows), ConTeXt, RTF, OPML, DocBook,
OpenDocument, ODT, Word docx, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki markup, DokuWiki
markup, Haddock markup, EPUB (v2 or v3), FictionBook2, Textile, groff
man pages, Emacs Org\-Mode, AsciiDoc, InDesign ICML, and Slidy,
Slideous, DZSlides, reveal.js or S5 HTML slide shows.
It can also produce PDF output on systems where LaTeX is installed.
.PP
Pandoc\[aq]s enhanced version of markdown includes syntax for footnotes,
tables, flexible ordered lists, definition lists, fenced code blocks,
superscript, subscript, strikeout, title blocks, automatic tables of
contents, embedded LaTeX math, citations, and markdown inside HTML block
elements.
(These enhancements, described below under Pandoc\[aq]s markdown, can be
disabled using the \f[C]markdown_strict\f[] input or output format.)
.PP
In contrast to most existing tools for converting markdown to HTML,
which use regex substitutions, Pandoc has a modular design: it consists
of a set of readers, which parse text in a given format and produce a
native representation of the document, and a set of writers, which
convert this native representation into a target format.
Thus, adding an input or output format requires only adding a reader or
writer.
.SS Using \f[C]pandoc\f[]
.PP
If no \f[I]input\-file\f[] is specified, input is read from
\f[I]stdin\f[].
Otherwise, the \f[I]input\-files\f[] are concatenated (with a blank line
between each) and used as input.
Output goes to \f[I]stdout\f[] by default (though output to
\f[I]stdout\f[] is disabled for the \f[C]odt\f[], \f[C]docx\f[],
\f[C]epub\f[], and \f[C]epub3\f[] output formats).
For output to a file, use the \f[C]\-o\f[] option:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-o\ output.html\ input.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
By default, pandoc produces a document fragment, not a standalone
document with a proper header and footer.
To produce a standalone document, use the \f[C]\-s\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-standalone\f[] flag:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-s\ \-o\ output.html\ input.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
For more information on how standalone documents are produced, see
Templates, below.
.PP
Instead of a file, an absolute URI may be given.
In this case pandoc will fetch the content using HTTP:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-f\ html\ \-t\ markdown\ http://www.fsf.org
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If multiple input files are given, \f[C]pandoc\f[] will concatenate them
all (with blank lines between them) before parsing.
This feature is disabled for binary input formats such as \f[C]EPUB\f[]
and \f[C]docx\f[].
.PP
The format of the input and output can be specified explicitly using
command\-line options.
The input format can be specified using the \f[C]\-r/\-\-read\f[] or
\f[C]\-f/\-\-from\f[] options, the output format using the
\f[C]\-w/\-\-write\f[] or \f[C]\-t/\-\-to\f[] options.
Thus, to convert \f[C]hello.txt\f[] from markdown to LaTeX, you could
type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-f\ markdown\ \-t\ latex\ hello.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To convert \f[C]hello.html\f[] from html to markdown:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-f\ html\ \-t\ markdown\ hello.html
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Supported output formats are listed below under the \f[C]\-t/\-\-to\f[]
option.
Supported input formats are listed below under the \f[C]\-f/\-\-from\f[]
option.
Note that the \f[C]rst\f[], \f[C]textile\f[], \f[C]latex\f[], and
\f[C]html\f[] readers are not complete; there are some constructs that
they do not parse.
.PP
If the input or output format is not specified explicitly,
\f[C]pandoc\f[] will attempt to guess it from the extensions of the
input and output filenames.
Thus, for example,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-o\ hello.tex\ hello.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will convert \f[C]hello.txt\f[] from markdown to LaTeX.
If no output file is specified (so that output goes to \f[I]stdout\f[]),
or if the output file\[aq]s extension is unknown, the output format will
default to HTML.
If no input file is specified (so that input comes from \f[I]stdin\f[]),
or if the input files\[aq] extensions are unknown, the input format will
be assumed to be markdown unless explicitly specified.
.PP
Pandoc uses the UTF\-8 character encoding for both input and output.
If your local character encoding is not UTF\-8, you should pipe input
and output through \f[C]iconv\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
iconv\ \-t\ utf\-8\ input.txt\ |\ pandoc\ |\ iconv\ \-f\ utf\-8
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that in some output formats (such as HTML, LaTeX, ConTeXt, RTF,
OPML, DocBook, and Texinfo), information about the character encoding is
included in the document header, which will only be included if you use
the \f[C]\-s/\-\-standalone\f[] option.
.SS Creating a PDF
.PP
Earlier versions of pandoc came with a program, \f[C]markdown2pdf\f[],
that used pandoc and pdflatex to produce a PDF.
This is no longer needed, since \f[C]pandoc\f[] can now produce
\f[C]pdf\f[] output itself.
To produce a PDF, simply specify an output file with a \f[C]\&.pdf\f[]
extension.
Pandoc will create a latex file and use pdflatex (or another engine, see
\f[C]\-\-latex\-engine\f[]) to convert it to PDF:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ test.txt\ \-o\ test.pdf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Production of a PDF requires that a LaTeX engine be installed (see
\f[C]\-\-latex\-engine\f[], below), and assumes that the following LaTeX
packages are available: \f[C]amssymb\f[], \f[C]amsmath\f[],
\f[C]ifxetex\f[], \f[C]ifluatex\f[], \f[C]listings\f[] (if the
\f[C]\-\-listings\f[] option is used), \f[C]fancyvrb\f[],
\f[C]longtable\f[], \f[C]booktabs\f[], \f[C]url\f[], \f[C]graphicx\f[]
and \f[C]grffile\f[] (if the document contains images),
\f[C]hyperref\f[], \f[C]ulem\f[], \f[C]babel\f[] (if the \f[C]lang\f[]
variable is set), \f[C]fontspec\f[] (if \f[C]xelatex\f[] or
\f[C]lualatex\f[] is used as the LaTeX engine), \f[C]xltxtra\f[] and
\f[C]xunicode\f[] (if \f[C]xelatex\f[] is used).
.SS \f[C]hsmarkdown\f[]
.PP
A user who wants a drop\-in replacement for \f[C]Markdown.pl\f[] may
create a symbolic link to the \f[C]pandoc\f[] executable called
\f[C]hsmarkdown\f[].
When invoked under the name \f[C]hsmarkdown\f[], \f[C]pandoc\f[] will
behave as if invoked with
\f[C]\-f\ markdown_strict\ \-\-email\-obfuscation=references\f[], and
all command\-line options will be treated as regular arguments.
However, this approach does not work under Cygwin, due to problems with
its simulation of symbolic links.

(MediaWiki markup), \f[C]twiki\f[] (TWiki markup), \f[C]haddock\f[]
(Haddock markup), or \f[C]latex\f[] (LaTeX).
If \f[C]+lhs\f[] is appended to \f[C]markdown\f[], \f[C]rst\f[],
\f[C]latex\f[], or \f[C]html\f[], the input will be treated as literate
Haskell source: see Literate Haskell support, below.
Markdown syntax extensions can be individually enabled or disabled by
appending \f[C]+EXTENSION\f[] or \f[C]\-EXTENSION\f[] to the format
name.
So, for example, \f[C]markdown_strict+footnotes+definition_lists\f[] is
strict markdown with footnotes and definition lists enabled, and
\f[C]markdown\-pipe_tables+hard_line_breaks\f[] is pandoc\[aq]s markdown
without pipe tables and with hard line breaks.
See Pandoc\[aq]s markdown, below, for a list of extensions and their
names.

(see Custom writers, below).
Note that \f[C]odt\f[], \f[C]epub\f[], and \f[C]epub3\f[] output will
not be directed to \f[I]stdout\f[]; an output filename must be specified
using the \f[C]\-o/\-\-output\f[] option.

.PP
Filters may be written in any language.

examples.
There are also pandoc filter libraries in PHP, perl, and
javascript/node.js.

.PP
Variables may be set at the command line using the
\f[C]\-V/\-\-variable\f[] option.
Variables set in this way override metadata fields with the same name.
.PP
Templates may contain conditionals.
The syntax is as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$if(variable)$
X
$else$
Y
$endif$
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will include \f[C]X\f[] in the template if \f[C]variable\f[] has a
non\-null value; otherwise it will include \f[C]Y\f[].
\f[C]X\f[] and \f[C]Y\f[] are placeholders for any valid template text,
and may include interpolated variables or other conditionals.
The \f[C]$else$\f[] section may be omitted.
.PP
When variables can have multiple values (for example, \f[C]author\f[] in
a multi\-author document), you can use the \f[C]$for$\f[] keyword:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$for(author)$
<meta\ name="author"\ content="$author$"\ />
$endfor$
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can optionally specify a separator to be used between consecutive
items:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$for(author)$$author$$sep$,\ $endfor$
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A dot can be used to select a field of a variable that takes an object
as its value.
So, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$author.name$\ ($author.affiliation$)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you use custom templates, you may need to revise them as pandoc
changes.
We recommend tracking the changes in the default templates, and
modifying your custom templates accordingly.
An easy way to do this is to fork the pandoc\-templates repository
(http://github.com/jgm/pandoc\-templates) and merge in changes after
each pandoc release.
.SH PANDOC\[aq]S MARKDOWN
.PP
Pandoc understands an extended and slightly revised version of John
Gruber\[aq]s markdown syntax.
This document explains the syntax, noting differences from standard
markdown.
Except where noted, these differences can be suppressed by using the
\f[C]markdown_strict\f[] format instead of \f[C]markdown\f[].
An extensions can be enabled by adding \f[C]+EXTENSION\f[] to the format
name and disabled by adding \f[C]\-EXTENSION\f[].
For example, \f[C]markdown_strict+footnotes\f[] is strict markdown with
footnotes enabled, while \f[C]markdown\-footnotes\-pipe_tables\f[] is
pandoc\[aq]s markdown without footnotes or pipe tables.
.SS Philosophy
.PP
Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly,
easy to read:
.RS
.PP
A Markdown\-formatted document should be publishable as\-is, as plain
text, without looking like it\[aq]s been marked up with tags or
formatting instructions.
\-\- John Gruber
.RE
.PP
This principle has guided pandoc\[aq]s decisions in finding syntax for
tables, footnotes, and other extensions.
.PP
There is, however, one respect in which pandoc\[aq]s aims are different
from the original aims of markdown.
Whereas markdown was originally designed with HTML generation in mind,
pandoc is designed for multiple output formats.
Thus, while pandoc allows the embedding of raw HTML, it discourages it,
and provides other, non\-HTMLish ways of representing important document
elements like definition lists, tables, mathematics, and footnotes.
.SS Paragraphs
.PP
A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by one or more blank
lines.
Newlines are treated as spaces, so you can reflow your paragraphs as you
like.
If you need a hard line break, put two or more spaces at the end of a
line.
.SS Extension: \f[C]escaped_line_breaks\f[]
.PP
A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard line break.
Note: in multiline and grid table cells, this is the only way to create
a hard line break, since trailing spaces in the cells are ignored.
.SS Headers
.PP
There are two kinds of headers, Setext and atx.
.SS Setext\-style headers
.PP
A setext\-style header is a line of text "underlined" with a row of
\f[C]=\f[] signs (for a level one header) or \f[C]\-\f[] signs (for a
level two header):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
A\ level\-one\ header
==================

A\ level\-two\ header
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The header text can contain inline formatting, such as emphasis (see
Inline formatting, below).
.SS Atx\-style headers
.PP
An Atx\-style header consists of one to six \f[C]#\f[] signs and a line
of text, optionally followed by any number of \f[C]#\f[] signs.
The number of \f[C]#\f[] signs at the beginning of the line is the
header level:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
##\ A\ level\-two\ header

###\ A\ level\-three\ header\ ###
\f[]
.fi
.PP
As with setext\-style headers, the header text can contain formatting:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ A\ level\-one\ header\ with\ a\ [link](/url)\ and\ *emphasis*
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]blank_before_header\f[]
.PP
Standard markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a header.
Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at the beginning of the
document).
The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for a
\f[C]#\f[] to end up at the beginning of a line by accident (perhaps
through line wrapping).
Consider, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
I\ like\ several\ of\ their\ flavors\ of\ ice\ cream:
#22,\ for\ example,\ and\ #5.
\f[]
.fi
.SS Header identifiers
.SS Extension: \f[C]header_attributes\f[]
.PP
Headers can be assigned attributes using this syntax at the end of the
line containing the header text:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{#identifier\ .class\ .class\ key=value\ key=value}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Thus, for example, the following headers will all be assigned the
identifier \f[C]foo\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ My\ header\ {#foo}

##\ My\ header\ ##\ \ \ \ {#foo}

My\ other\ header\ \ \ {#foo}
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\f[]
.fi
.PP
(This syntax is compatible with PHP Markdown Extra.)
.PP
Note that although this syntax allows assignment of classes and
key/value attributes, writers generally don\[aq]t use all of this
information.
Identifiers, classes, and key/value attributes are used in HTML and
HTML\-based formats such as EPUB and slidy.
Identifiers are used for labels and link anchors in the LaTeX, ConTeXt,
Textile, and AsciiDoc writers.
.PP
Headers with the class \f[C]unnumbered\f[] will not be numbered, even if
\f[C]\-\-number\-sections\f[] is specified.
A single hyphen (\f[C]\-\f[]) in an attribute context is equivalent to
\f[C]\&.unnumbered\f[], and preferable in non\-English documents.
So,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ My\ header\ {\-}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
is just the same as
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ My\ header\ {.unnumbered}
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]auto_identifiers\f[]
.PP
A header without an explicitly specified identifier will be
automatically assigned a unique identifier based on the header text.
To derive the identifier from the header text,
.IP \[bu] 2
Remove all formatting, links, etc.
.IP \[bu] 2
Remove all footnotes.
.IP \[bu] 2
Remove all punctuation, except underscores, hyphens, and periods.
.IP \[bu] 2
Replace all spaces and newlines with hyphens.
.IP \[bu] 2
Convert all alphabetic characters to lowercase.
.IP \[bu] 2
Remove everything up to the first letter (identifiers may not begin with
a number or punctuation mark).
.IP \[bu] 2
If nothing is left after this, use the identifier \f[C]section\f[].
.PP
Thus, for example,
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l l.

.TE
.PP
These rules should, in most cases, allow one to determine the identifier
from the header text.
The exception is when several headers have the same text; in this case,
the first will get an identifier as described above; the second will get
the same identifier with \f[C]\-1\f[] appended; the third with
\f[C]\-2\f[]; and so on.
.PP
These identifiers are used to provide link targets in the table of
contents generated by the \f[C]\-\-toc|\-\-table\-of\-contents\f[]
option.
They also make it easy to provide links from one section of a document
to another.
A link to this section, for example, might look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
See\ the\ section\ on
[header\ identifiers](#header\-identifiers\-in\-html\-latex\-and\-context).
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note, however, that this method of providing links to sections works
only in HTML, LaTeX, and ConTeXt formats.
.PP
If the \f[C]\-\-section\-divs\f[] option is specified, then each section
will be wrapped in a \f[C]div\f[] (or a \f[C]section\f[], if
\f[C]\-\-html5\f[] was specified), and the identifier will be attached
to the enclosing \f[C]<div>\f[] (or \f[C]<section>\f[]) tag rather than
the header itself.
This allows entire sections to be manipulated using javascript or
treated differently in CSS.
.SS Extension: \f[C]implicit_header_references\f[]
.PP
Pandoc behaves as if reference links have been defined for each header.
So, instead of
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[header\ identifiers](#header\-identifiers\-in\-html)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
you can simply write
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[header\ identifiers]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[header\ identifiers][]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[the\ section\ on\ header\ identifiers][header\ identifiers]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If there are multiple headers with identical text, the corresponding
reference will link to the first one only, and you will need to use
explicit links to link to the others, as described above.
.PP
Like regular reference links, these references are case\-insensitive.
.PP
Explicit link reference definitions always take priority over implicit
header references.
So, in the following example, the link will point to \f[C]bar\f[], not
to \f[C]#foo\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ Foo

[foo]:\ bar

See\ [foo]
\f[]
.fi
.SS Block quotations
.PP
Markdown uses email conventions for quoting blocks of text.
A block quotation is one or more paragraphs or other block elements
(such as lists or headers), with each line preceded by a \f[C]>\f[]
character and a space.
(The \f[C]>\f[] need not start at the left margin, but it should not be
indented more than three spaces.)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>\ This\ is\ a\ block\ quote.\ This
>\ paragraph\ has\ two\ lines.
>
>\ 1.\ This\ is\ a\ list\ inside\ a\ block\ quote.
>\ 2.\ Second\ item.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A "lazy" form, which requires the \f[C]>\f[] character only on the first
line of each block, is also allowed:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>\ This\ is\ a\ block\ quote.\ This
paragraph\ has\ two\ lines.

>\ 1.\ This\ is\ a\ list\ inside\ a\ block\ quote.
2.\ Second\ item.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Among the block elements that can be contained in a block quote are
other block quotes.
That is, block quotes can be nested:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>\ This\ is\ a\ block\ quote.
>
>\ >\ A\ block\ quote\ within\ a\ block\ quote.
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]blank_before_blockquote\f[]
.PP
Standard markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a block
quote.
Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at the beginning of the
document).
The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for a
\f[C]>\f[] to end up at the beginning of a line by accident (perhaps
through line wrapping).
So, unless the \f[C]markdown_strict\f[] format is used, the following
does not produce a nested block quote in pandoc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>\ This\ is\ a\ block\ quote.
>>\ Nested.
\f[]
.fi
.SS Verbatim (code) blocks
.SS Indented code blocks
.PP
A block of text indented four spaces (or one tab) is treated as verbatim
text: that is, special characters do not trigger special formatting, and
all spaces and line breaks are preserved.
For example,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ if\ (a\ >\ 3)\ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ moveShip(5\ *\ gravity,\ DOWN);
\ \ \ \ }
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The initial (four space or one tab) indentation is not considered part
of the verbatim text, and is removed in the output.
.PP
Note: blank lines in the verbatim text need not begin with four spaces.
.SS Fenced code blocks
.SS Extension: \f[C]fenced_code_blocks\f[]
.PP
In addition to standard indented code blocks, Pandoc supports
\f[I]fenced\f[] code blocks.
These begin with a row of three or more tildes (\f[C]~\f[]) and end with
a row of tildes that must be at least as long as the starting row.
Everything between these lines is treated as code.
No indentation is necessary:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
~~~~~~~
if\ (a\ >\ 3)\ {
\ \ moveShip(5\ *\ gravity,\ DOWN);
}
~~~~~~~
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Like regular code blocks, fenced code blocks must be separated from
surrounding text by blank lines.
.PP
If the code itself contains a row of tildes or backticks, just use a
longer row of tildes or backticks at the start and end:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
code\ including\ tildes
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]backtick_code_blocks\f[]
.PP
Same as \f[C]fenced_code_blocks\f[], but uses backticks (\f[C]`\f[])
instead of tildes (\f[C]~\f[]).
.SS Extension: \f[C]fenced_code_attributes\f[]
.PP
Optionally, you may attach attributes to fenced or backtick code block
using this syntax:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
~~~~\ {#mycode\ .haskell\ .numberLines\ startFrom="100"}
qsort\ []\ \ \ \ \ =\ []
qsort\ (x:xs)\ =\ qsort\ (filter\ (<\ x)\ xs)\ ++\ [x]\ ++
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ qsort\ (filter\ (>=\ x)\ xs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Here \f[C]mycode\f[] is an identifier, \f[C]haskell\f[] and
\f[C]numberLines\f[] are classes, and \f[C]startFrom\f[] is an attribute
with value \f[C]100\f[].
Some output formats can use this information to do syntax highlighting.
Currently, the only output formats that uses this information are HTML
and LaTeX.
If highlighting is supported for your output format and language, then
the code block above will appear highlighted, with numbered lines.
(To see which languages are supported, do \f[C]pandoc\ \-\-version\f[].)
Otherwise, the code block above will appear as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<pre\ id="mycode"\ class="haskell\ numberLines"\ startFrom="100">
\ \ <code>
\ \ ...
\ \ </code>
</pre>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A shortcut form can also be used for specifying the language of the code
block:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
```haskell
qsort\ []\ =\ []
```
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This is equivalent to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
```\ {.haskell}
qsort\ []\ =\ []
```
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If the \f[C]fenced_code_attributes\f[] extension is disabled, but input
contains class attribute(s) for the codeblock, the first class attribute
will be printed after the opening fence as a bare word.
.PP
To prevent all highlighting, use the \f[C]\-\-no\-highlight\f[] flag.
To set the highlighting style, use \f[C]\-\-highlight\-style\f[].
For more information on highlighting, see Syntax highlighting, below.
.SS Line blocks
.SS Extension: \f[C]line_blocks\f[]
.PP
A line block is a sequence of lines beginning with a vertical bar
(\f[C]|\f[]) followed by a space.
The division into lines will be preserved in the output, as will any
leading spaces; otherwise, the lines will be formatted as markdown.
This is useful for verse and addresses:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
|\ The\ limerick\ packs\ laughs\ anatomical
|\ In\ space\ that\ is\ quite\ economical.
|\ \ \ \ But\ the\ good\ ones\ I\[aq]ve\ seen
|\ \ \ \ So\ seldom\ are\ clean
|\ And\ the\ clean\ ones\ so\ seldom\ are\ comical

|\ 200\ Main\ St.
|\ Berkeley,\ CA\ 94718
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The lines can be hard\-wrapped if needed, but the continuation line must
begin with a space.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
|\ The\ Right\ Honorable\ Most\ Venerable\ and\ Righteous\ Samuel\ L.
\ \ Constable,\ Jr.
|\ 200\ Main\ St.
|\ Berkeley,\ CA\ 94718
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This syntax is borrowed from reStructuredText.
.SS Lists
.SS Bullet lists
.PP
A bullet list is a list of bulleted list items.
A bulleted list item begins with a bullet (\f[C]*\f[], \f[C]+\f[], or
\f[C]\-\f[]).
Here is a simple example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*\ one
*\ two
*\ three
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will produce a "compact" list.
If you want a "loose" list, in which each item is formatted as a
paragraph, put spaces between the items:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*\ one

*\ two

*\ three
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The bullets need not be flush with the left margin; they may be indented
one, two, or three spaces.
The bullet must be followed by whitespace.
.PP
List items look best if subsequent lines are flush with the first line
(after the bullet):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*\ here\ is\ my\ first
\ \ list\ item.
*\ and\ my\ second.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
But markdown also allows a "lazy" format:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*\ here\ is\ my\ first
list\ item.
*\ and\ my\ second.
\f[]
.fi
.SS The four\-space rule
.PP
A list item may contain multiple paragraphs and other block\-level
content.
However, subsequent paragraphs must be preceded by a blank line and
indented four spaces or a tab.
The list will look better if the first paragraph is aligned with the
rest:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ *\ First\ paragraph.

\ \ \ \ Continued.

\ \ *\ Second\ paragraph.\ With\ a\ code\ block,\ which\ must\ be\ indented
\ \ \ \ eight\ spaces:

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\ code\ }
\f[]
.fi
.PP
List items may include other lists.
In this case the preceding blank line is optional.
The nested list must be indented four spaces or one tab:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*\ fruits
\ \ \ \ +\ apples
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ macintosh
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \-\ red\ delicious
\ \ \ \ +\ pears
\ \ \ \ +\ peaches
*\ vegetables
\ \ \ \ +\ broccoli
\ \ \ \ +\ chard
\f[]
.fi
.PP
As noted above, markdown allows you to write list items "lazily,"
instead of indenting continuation lines.
However, if there are multiple paragraphs or other blocks in a list
item, the first line of each must be indented.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
+\ A\ lazy,\ lazy,\ list
item.

+\ Another\ one;\ this\ looks
bad\ but\ is\ legal.

\ \ \ \ Second\ paragraph\ of\ second
list\ item.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[] Although the four\-space rule for continuation paragraphs
comes from the official markdown syntax guide, the reference
implementation, \f[C]Markdown.pl\f[], does not follow it.
So pandoc will give different results than \f[C]Markdown.pl\f[] when
authors have indented continuation paragraphs fewer than four spaces.
.PP
The markdown syntax guide is not explicit whether the four\-space rule
applies to \f[I]all\f[] block\-level content in a list item; it only
mentions paragraphs and code blocks.
But it implies that the rule applies to all block\-level content
(including nested lists), and pandoc interprets it that way.
.SS Ordered lists
.PP
Ordered lists work just like bulleted lists, except that the items begin
with enumerators rather than bullets.
.PP
In standard markdown, enumerators are decimal numbers followed by a
period and a space.
The numbers themselves are ignored, so there is no difference between
this list:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
1.\ \ one
2.\ \ two
3.\ \ three
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and this one:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
5.\ \ one
7.\ \ two
1.\ \ three
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]fancy_lists\f[]
.PP
Unlike standard markdown, Pandoc allows ordered list items to be marked
with uppercase and lowercase letters and roman numerals, in addition to
arabic numerals.
List markers may be enclosed in parentheses or followed by a single
right\-parentheses or period.
They must be separated from the text that follows by at least one space,
and, if the list marker is a capital letter with a period, by at least
two spaces.
.PP
The \f[C]fancy_lists\f[] extension also allows \[aq]\f[C]#\f[]\[aq] to
be used as an ordered list marker in place of a numeral:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#.\ one
#.\ two
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]startnum\f[]
.PP
Pandoc also pays attention to the type of list marker used, and to the
starting number, and both of these are preserved where possible in the
output format.
Thus, the following yields a list with numbers followed by a single
parenthesis, starting with 9, and a sublist with lowercase roman
numerals:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ 9)\ \ Ninth
10)\ \ Tenth
11)\ \ Eleventh
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ i.\ subone
\ \ \ \ \ \ ii.\ subtwo
\ \ \ \ \ iii.\ subthree
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Pandoc will start a new list each time a different type of list marker
is used.
So, the following will create three lists:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
(2)\ Two
(5)\ Three
1.\ \ Four
*\ \ \ Five
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If default list markers are desired, use \f[C]#.\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#.\ \ one
#.\ \ two
#.\ \ three
\f[]
.fi
.SS Definition lists
.SS Extension: \f[C]definition_lists\f[]
.PP
Pandoc supports definition lists, using the syntax of PHP Markdown Extra
with some extensions.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Term\ 1

:\ \ \ Definition\ 1

Term\ 2\ with\ *inline\ markup*

:\ \ \ Definition\ 2

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\ some\ code,\ part\ of\ Definition\ 2\ }

\ \ \ \ Third\ paragraph\ of\ definition\ 2.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Each term must fit on one line, which may optionally be followed by a
blank line, and must be followed by one or more definitions.
A definition begins with a colon or tilde, which may be indented one or
two spaces.
.PP
A term may have multiple definitions, and each definition may consist of
one or more block elements (paragraph, code block, list, etc.), each
indented four spaces or one tab stop.
The body of the definition (including the first line, aside from the
colon or tilde) should be indented four spaces.
However, as with other markdown lists, you can "lazily" omit indentation
except at the beginning of a paragraph or other block element:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Term\ 1

:\ \ \ Definition
with\ lazy\ continuation.

\ \ \ \ Second\ paragraph\ of\ the\ definition.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you leave space before the definition (as in the example above), the
text of the definition will be treated as a paragraph.
In some output formats, this will mean greater spacing between
term/definition pairs.
For a more compact definition list, omit the space before the
definition:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Term\ 1
\ \ ~\ Definition\ 1

Term\ 2
\ \ ~\ Definition\ 2a
\ \ ~\ Definition\ 2b
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that space between items in a definition list is required.
(A variant that loosens this requirement, but disallows "lazy" hard
wrapping, can be activated with \f[C]compact_definition_lists\f[]: see
Non\-pandoc extensions, below.)
.SS Numbered example lists
.SS Extension: \f[C]example_lists\f[]
.PP
The special list marker \f[C]\@\f[] can be used for sequentially
numbered examples.
The first list item with a \f[C]\@\f[] marker will be numbered
\[aq]1\[aq], the next \[aq]2\[aq], and so on, throughout the document.
The numbered examples need not occur in a single list; each new list
using \f[C]\@\f[] will take up where the last stopped.
So, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
(\@)\ \ My\ first\ example\ will\ be\ numbered\ (1).
(\@)\ \ My\ second\ example\ will\ be\ numbered\ (2).

Explanation\ of\ examples.

(\@)\ \ My\ third\ example\ will\ be\ numbered\ (3).
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Numbered examples can be labeled and referred to elsewhere in the
document:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
(\@good)\ \ This\ is\ a\ good\ example.

As\ (\@good)\ illustrates,\ ...
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The label can be any string of alphanumeric characters, underscores, or
hyphens.
.SS Compact and loose lists
.PP
Pandoc behaves differently from \f[C]Markdown.pl\f[] on some "edge
cases" involving lists.
Consider this source:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
+\ \ \ First
+\ \ \ Second:
\ \ \ \ \-\ \ \ Fee
\ \ \ \ \-\ \ \ Fie
\ \ \ \ \-\ \ \ Foe

+\ \ \ Third
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Pandoc transforms this into a "compact list" (with no \f[C]<p>\f[] tags
around "First", "Second", or "Third"), while markdown puts \f[C]<p>\f[]
tags around "Second" and "Third" (but not "First"), because of the blank
space around "Third".
Pandoc follows a simple rule: if the text is followed by a blank line,
it is treated as a paragraph.
Since "Second" is followed by a list, and not a blank line, it isn\[aq]t
treated as a paragraph.
The fact that the list is followed by a blank line is irrelevant.
(Note: Pandoc works this way even when the \f[C]markdown_strict\f[]
format is specified.
This behavior is consistent with the official markdown syntax
description, even though it is different from that of
\f[C]Markdown.pl\f[].)
.SS Ending a list
.PP
What if you want to put an indented code block after a list?
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\ \ \ item\ one
\-\ \ \ item\ two

\ \ \ \ {\ my\ code\ block\ }
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Trouble! Here pandoc (like other markdown implementations) will treat
\f[C]{\ my\ code\ block\ }\f[] as the second paragraph of item two, and
not as a code block.
.PP
To "cut off" the list after item two, you can insert some non\-indented
content, like an HTML comment, which won\[aq]t produce visible output in
any format:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\ \ \ item\ one
\-\ \ \ item\ two

<!\-\-\ end\ of\ list\ \-\->

\ \ \ \ {\ my\ code\ block\ }
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can use the same trick if you want two consecutive lists instead of
one big list:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
1.\ \ one
2.\ \ two
3.\ \ three

<!\-\-\ \-\->

1.\ \ uno
2.\ \ dos
3.\ \ tres
\f[]
.fi
.SS Horizontal rules
.PP
A line containing a row of three or more \f[C]*\f[], \f[C]\-\f[], or
\f[C]_\f[] characters (optionally separated by spaces) produces a
horizontal rule:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*\ \ *\ \ *\ \ *

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\f[]
.fi
.SS Tables
.PP
Four kinds of tables may be used.
The first three kinds presuppose the use of a fixed\-width font, such as
Courier.
The fourth kind can be used with proportionally spaced fonts, as it does
not require lining up columns.
.SS Extension: \f[C]table_captions\f[]
.PP
A caption may optionally be provided with all 4 kinds of tables (as
illustrated in the examples below).
A caption is a paragraph beginning with the string \f[C]Table:\f[] (or
just \f[C]:\f[]), which will be stripped off.
It may appear either before or after the table.
.SS Extension: \f[C]simple_tables\f[]
.PP
Simple tables look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ Right\ \ \ \ \ Left\ \ \ \ \ Center\ \ \ \ \ Default
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \ \ \ \ \-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \ \ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\ \ \ \ \ 12\ \ \ \ \ 12\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 12\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 12
\ \ \ \ 123\ \ \ \ \ 123\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 123\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 123
\ \ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1

Table:\ \ Demonstration\ of\ simple\ table\ syntax.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The headers and table rows must each fit on one line.
Column alignments are determined by the position of the header text
relative to the dashed line below it:
.IP \[bu] 2
If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the right side but
extends beyond it on the left, the column is right\-aligned.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the left side but
extends beyond it on the right, the column is left\-aligned.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the dashed line extends beyond the header text on both sides, the
column is centered.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the dashed line is flush with the header text on both sides, the
default alignment is used (in most cases, this will be left).
.PP
The table must end with a blank line, or a line of dashes followed by a
blank line.
.PP
The column headers may be omitted, provided a dashed line is used to end
the table.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \ \ \ \ \-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \ \ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\ \ \ \ \ 12\ \ \ \ \ 12\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 12\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 12
\ \ \ \ 123\ \ \ \ \ 123\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 123\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 123
\ \ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \ \ \ \ \-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \ \ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\f[]
.fi
.PP
When headers are omitted, column alignments are determined on the basis
of the first line of the table body.
So, in the tables above, the columns would be right, left, center, and
right aligned, respectively.
.SS Extension: \f[C]multiline_tables\f[]
.PP
Multiline tables allow headers and table rows to span multiple lines of
text (but cells that span multiple columns or rows of the table are not
supported).
Here is an example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\ Centered\ \ \ Default\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Right\ Left
\ \ Header\ \ \ \ Aligned\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Aligned\ Aligned
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\ \ \ First\ \ \ \ row\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 12.0\ Example\ of\ a\ row\ that
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ spans\ multiple\ lines.

\ \ Second\ \ \ \ row\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 5.0\ Here\[aq]s\ another\ one.\ Note
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ the\ blank\ line\ between
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ rows.
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Table:\ Here\[aq]s\ the\ caption.\ It,\ too,\ may\ span
multiple\ lines.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
These work like simple tables, but with the following differences:
.IP \[bu] 2
They must begin with a row of dashes, before the header text (unless the
headers are omitted).
.IP \[bu] 2
They must end with a row of dashes, then a blank line.
.IP \[bu] 2
The rows must be separated by blank lines.
.PP
In multiline tables, the table parser pays attention to the widths of
the columns, and the writers try to reproduce these relative widths in
the output.
So, if you find that one of the columns is too narrow in the output, try
widening it in the markdown source.
.PP
Headers may be omitted in multiline tables as well as simple tables:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\ \ Second\ \ \ \ row\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 5.0\ Here\[aq]s\ another\ one.\ Note
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ the\ blank\ line\ between

:\ Here\[aq]s\ a\ multiline\ table\ without\ headers.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
It is possible for a multiline table to have just one row, but the row
should be followed by a blank line (and then the row of dashes that ends
the table), or the table may be interpreted as a simple table.
.SS Extension: \f[C]grid_tables\f[]
.PP
Grid tables look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
:\ Sample\ grid\ table.

+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+

\f[]
.fi
.PP
The row of \f[C]=\f[]s separates the header from the table body, and can
be omitted for a headerless table.
The cells of grid tables may contain arbitrary block elements (multiple
paragraphs, code blocks, lists, etc.).
Alignments are not supported, nor are cells that span multiple columns
or rows.
Grid tables can be created easily using Emacs table mode.
.SS Extension: \f[C]pipe_tables\f[]
.PP
Pipe tables look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
|\ Right\ |\ Left\ |\ Default\ |\ Center\ |
|\-\-\-\-\-\-:|:\-\-\-\-\-|\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-|:\-\-\-\-\-\-:|
|\ \ \ 12\ \ |\ \ 12\ \ |\ \ \ \ 12\ \ \ |\ \ \ \ 12\ \ |
|\ \ 123\ \ |\ \ 123\ |\ \ \ 123\ \ \ |\ \ \ 123\ \ |
|\ \ \ \ 1\ \ |\ \ \ \ 1\ |\ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ \ |\ \ \ \ \ 1\ \ |

\ \ :\ Demonstration\ of\ pipe\ table\ syntax.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The syntax is the same as in PHP markdown extra.
The beginning and ending pipe characters are optional, but pipes are
required between all columns.
The colons indicate column alignment as shown.
The header cannot be omitted.
To simulate a headerless table, include a header with blank cells.
.PP
Since the pipes indicate column boundaries, columns need not be
vertically aligned, as they are in the above example.
So, this is a perfectly legal (though ugly) pipe table:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
fruit|\ price
\-\-\-\-\-|\-\-\-\-\-:
apple|2.05
pear|1.37
orange|3.09
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The cells of pipe tables cannot contain block elements like paragraphs
and lists, and cannot span multiple lines.
Note also that in LaTeX/PDF output, the cells produced by pipe tables
will not wrap, since there is no information available about relative
widths.
If you want content to wrap within cells, use multiline or grid tables.
.PP
Note: Pandoc also recognizes pipe tables of the following form, as can
be produced by Emacs\[aq] orgtbl\-mode:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
|\ One\ |\ Two\ \ \ |
|\-\-\-\-\-+\-\-\-\-\-\-\-|
|\ my\ \ |\ table\ |
|\ is\ \ |\ nice\ \ |
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The difference is that \f[C]+\f[] is used instead of \f[C]|\f[].
Other orgtbl features are not supported.
In particular, to get non\-default column alignment, you\[aq]ll need to
add colons as above.
.SS Metadata blocks
.SS Extension: \f[C]pandoc_title_block\f[]
.PP
If the file begins with a title block
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%\ title
%\ author(s)\ (separated\ by\ semicolons)
%\ date
\f[]
.fi
.PP
it will be parsed as bibliographic information, not regular text.
(It will be used, for example, in the title of standalone LaTeX or HTML
output.) The block may contain just a title, a title and an author, or
all three elements.
If you want to include an author but no title, or a title and a date but
no author, you need a blank line:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%
%\ Author

%\ My\ title
%
%\ June\ 15,\ 2006
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The title may occupy multiple lines, but continuation lines must begin
with leading space, thus:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%\ My\ title
\ \ on\ multiple\ lines
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If a document has multiple authors, the authors may be put on separate
lines with leading space, or separated by semicolons, or both.
So, all of the following are equivalent:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%\ Author\ One
\ \ Author\ Two

%\ Author\ One;\ Author\ Two

%\ Author\ One;
\ \ Author\ Two
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The date must fit on one line.
.PP
All three metadata fields may contain standard inline formatting
(italics, links, footnotes, etc.).
.PP
Title blocks will always be parsed, but they will affect the output only
when the \f[C]\-\-standalone\f[] (\f[C]\-s\f[]) option is chosen.
In HTML output, titles will appear twice: once in the document head \-\-
this is the title that will appear at the top of the window in a browser
\-\- and once at the beginning of the document body.
The title in the document head can have an optional prefix attached
(\f[C]\-\-title\-prefix\f[] or \f[C]\-T\f[] option).
The title in the body appears as an H1 element with class "title", so it
can be suppressed or reformatted with CSS.
If a title prefix is specified with \f[C]\-T\f[] and no title block
appears in the document, the title prefix will be used by itself as the
HTML title.
.PP
The man page writer extracts a title, man page section number, and other
header and footer information from the title line.
The title is assumed to be the first word on the title line, which may
optionally end with a (single\-digit) section number in parentheses.
(There should be no space between the title and the parentheses.)
Anything after this is assumed to be additional footer and header text.
A single pipe character (\f[C]|\f[]) should be used to separate the
footer text from the header text.
Thus,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%\ PANDOC(1)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will yield a man page with the title \f[C]PANDOC\f[] and section 1.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%\ PANDOC(1)\ Pandoc\ User\ Manuals
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will also have "Pandoc User Manuals" in the footer.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%\ PANDOC(1)\ Pandoc\ User\ Manuals\ |\ Version\ 4.0
\f[]
.fi
.PP
will also have "Version 4.0" in the header.
.SS Extension: \f[C]yaml_metadata_block\f[]
.PP
A YAML metadata block is a valid YAML object, delimited by a line of
three hyphens (\f[C]\-\-\-\f[]) at the top and a line of three hyphens
(\f[C]\-\-\-\f[]) or three dots (\f[C]\&...\f[]) at the bottom.
A YAML metadata block may occur anywhere in the document, but if it is
not at the beginning, it must be preceded by a blank line.
(Note that, because of the way pandoc concatenates input files when
several are provided, you may also keep the metadata in a separate YAML
file and pass it to pandoc as an argument, along with your markdown
files:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ chap1.md\ chap2.md\ chap3.md\ metadata.yaml\ \-s\ \-o\ book.html
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Just be sure that the YAML file begins with \f[C]\-\-\-\f[] and ends
with \f[C]\-\-\-\f[] or \f[C]\&...\f[].)
.PP
Metadata will be taken from the fields of the YAML object and added to
any existing document metadata.
Metadata can contain lists and objects (nested arbitrarily), but all
string scalars will be interpreted as markdown.
Fields with names ending in an underscore will be ignored by pandoc.
(They may be given a role by external processors.)
.PP
A document may contain multiple metadata blocks.
The metadata fields will be combined through a \f[I]left\-biased
union\f[]: if two metadata blocks attempt to set the same field, the
value from the first block will be taken.
.PP
When pandoc is used with \f[C]\-t\ markdown\f[] to create a markdown
document, a YAML metadata block will be produced only if the
\f[C]\-s/\-\-standalone\f[] option is used.
All of the metadata will appear in a single block at the beginning of
the document.
.PP
Note that YAML escaping rules must be followed.
Thus, for example, if a title contains a colon, it must be quoted.
The pipe character (\f[C]|\f[]) can be used to begin an indented block
that will be interpreted literally, without need for escaping.
This form is necessary when the field contains blank lines:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-\-
title:\ \ \[aq]This\ is\ the\ title:\ it\ contains\ a\ colon\[aq]
author:
\-\ name:\ Author\ One
\ \ affiliation:\ University\ of\ Somewhere
\-\ name:\ Author\ Two
\ \ affiliation:\ University\ of\ Nowhere
tags:\ [nothing,\ nothingness]
abstract:\ |
\ \ This\ is\ the\ abstract.

\ \ It\ consists\ of\ two\ paragraphs.
\&...
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Template variables will be set automatically from the metadata.
Thus, for example, in writing HTML, the variable \f[C]abstract\f[] will
be set to the HTML equivalent of the markdown in the \f[C]abstract\f[]
field:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<p>This\ is\ the\ abstract.</p>
<p>It\ consists\ of\ two\ paragraphs.</p>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note: The \f[C]author\f[] variable in the default templates expects a
simple list or string.
To use the structured authors in the example, you would need a custom
template.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$for(author)$
$if(author.name)$
$author.name$$if(author.affiliation)$\ ($author.affiliation$)$endif$
$else$
$author$
$endif$
$endfor$
\f[]
.fi
.SS Backslash escapes
.SS Extension: \f[C]all_symbols_escapable\f[]
.PP
Except inside a code block or inline code, any punctuation or space
character preceded by a backslash will be treated literally, even if it
would normally indicate formatting.
Thus, for example, if one writes
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*\\*hello\\**
\f[]
.fi
.PP
one will get
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<em>*hello*</em>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
instead of
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<strong>hello</strong>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This rule is easier to remember than standard markdown\[aq]s rule, which
allows only the following characters to be backslash\-escaped:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\\`*_{}[]()>#+\-.!
\f[]
.fi
.PP
(However, if the \f[C]markdown_strict\f[] format is used, the standard
markdown rule will be used.)
.PP
A backslash\-escaped space is parsed as a nonbreaking space.
It will appear in TeX output as \f[C]~\f[] and in HTML and XML as
\f[C]\\&#160;\f[] or \f[C]\\&nbsp;\f[].
.PP
A backslash\-escaped newline (i.e.
a backslash occurring at the end of a line) is parsed as a hard line
break.
It will appear in TeX output as \f[C]\\\\\f[] and in HTML as
\f[C]<br\ />\f[].
This is a nice alternative to markdown\[aq]s "invisible" way of
indicating hard line breaks using two trailing spaces on a line.
.PP
Backslash escapes do not work in verbatim contexts.
.SS Smart punctuation
.SS Extension
.PP
If the \f[C]\-\-smart\f[] option is specified, pandoc will produce
typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly
quotes, \f[C]\-\-\-\f[] to em\-dashes, \f[C]\-\-\f[] to en\-dashes, and
\f[C]\&...\f[] to ellipses.
Nonbreaking spaces are inserted after certain abbreviations, such as
"Mr."
.PP
Note: if your LaTeX template uses the \f[C]csquotes\f[] package, pandoc
will detect automatically this and use \f[C]\\enquote{...}\f[] for
quoted text.
.SS Inline formatting
.SS Emphasis
.PP
To \f[I]emphasize\f[] some text, surround it with \f[C]*\f[]s or
\f[C]_\f[], like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This\ text\ is\ _emphasized\ with\ underscores_,\ and\ this
is\ *emphasized\ with\ asterisks*.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Double \f[C]*\f[] or \f[C]_\f[] produces \f[B]strong emphasis\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This\ is\ **strong\ emphasis**\ and\ __with\ underscores__.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A \f[C]*\f[] or \f[C]_\f[] character surrounded by spaces, or
backslash\-escaped, will not trigger emphasis:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This\ is\ *\ not\ emphasized\ *,\ and\ \\*neither\ is\ this\\*.
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]intraword_underscores\f[]
.PP
Because \f[C]_\f[] is sometimes used inside words and identifiers,
pandoc does not interpret a \f[C]_\f[] surrounded by alphanumeric
characters as an emphasis marker.
If you want to emphasize just part of a word, use \f[C]*\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
feas*ible*,\ not\ feas*able*.
\f[]
.fi
.SS Strikeout
.SS Extension: \f[C]strikeout\f[]
.PP
To strikeout a section of text with a horizontal line, begin and end it
with \f[C]~~\f[].
Thus, for example,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This\ ~~is\ deleted\ text.~~
\f[]
.fi
.SS Superscripts and subscripts
.SS Extension: \f[C]superscript\f[], \f[C]subscript\f[]
.PP
Superscripts may be written by surrounding the superscripted text by
\f[C]^\f[] characters; subscripts may be written by surrounding the
subscripted text by \f[C]~\f[] characters.
Thus, for example,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
H~2~O\ is\ a\ liquid.\ \ 2^10^\ is\ 1024.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If the superscripted or subscripted text contains spaces, these spaces
must be escaped with backslashes.
(This is to prevent accidental superscripting and subscripting through
the ordinary use of \f[C]~\f[] and \f[C]^\f[].) Thus, if you want the
letter P with \[aq]a cat\[aq] in subscripts, use \f[C]P~a\\\ cat~\f[],
not \f[C]P~a\ cat~\f[].
.SS Verbatim
.PP
To make a short span of text verbatim, put it inside backticks:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
What\ is\ the\ difference\ between\ `>>=`\ and\ `>>`?
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If the verbatim text includes a backtick, use double backticks:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Here\ is\ a\ literal\ backtick\ ``\ `\ ``.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
(The spaces after the opening backticks and before the closing backticks
will be ignored.)
.PP
The general rule is that a verbatim span starts with a string of
consecutive backticks (optionally followed by a space) and ends with a
string of the same number of backticks (optionally preceded by a space).
.PP
Note that backslash\-escapes (and other markdown constructs) do not work
in verbatim contexts:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This\ is\ a\ backslash\ followed\ by\ an\ asterisk:\ `\\*`.
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]inline_code_attributes\f[]
.PP
Attributes can be attached to verbatim text, just as with fenced code
blocks:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
`<$>`{.haskell}
\f[]
.fi
.SS Small caps
.PP
To write small caps, you can use an HTML span tag:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<span\ style="font\-variant:small\-caps;">Small\ caps</span>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
(The semicolon is optional and there may be space after the colon.) This
will work in all output formats that support small caps.
.SS Math
.SS Extension: \f[C]tex_math_dollars\f[]
.PP
Anything between two \f[C]$\f[] characters will be treated as TeX math.
The opening \f[C]$\f[] must have a non\-space character immediately to
its right, while the closing \f[C]$\f[] must have a non\-space character
immediately to its left, and must not be followed immediately by a
digit.
Thus, \f[C]$20,000\ and\ $30,000\f[] won\[aq]t parse as math.
If for some reason you need to enclose text in literal \f[C]$\f[]
characters, backslash\-escape them and they won\[aq]t be treated as math
delimiters.
.PP
TeX math will be printed in all output formats.
How it is rendered depends on the output format:
.TP
.B Markdown, LaTeX, Org\-Mode, ConTeXt
It will appear verbatim between \f[C]$\f[] characters.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B reStructuredText
It will be rendered using an interpreted text role \f[C]:math:\f[], as
described here
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B AsciiDoc
It will be rendered as \f[C]latexmath:[...]\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B Texinfo
It will be rendered inside a \f[C]\@math\f[] command.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B groff man
It will be rendered verbatim without \f[C]$\f[]\[aq]s.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B MediaWiki, DokuWiki
It will be rendered inside \f[C]<math>\f[] tags.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B Textile
It will be rendered inside \f[C]<span\ class="math">\f[] tags.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B RTF, OpenDocument, ODT
It will be rendered, if possible, using unicode characters, and will
otherwise appear verbatim.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B Docbook
If the \f[C]\-\-mathml\f[] flag is used, it will be rendered using
mathml in an \f[C]inlineequation\f[] or \f[C]informalequation\f[] tag.
Otherwise it will be rendered, if possible, using unicode characters.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B Docx
It will be rendered using OMML math markup.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B FictionBook2
If the \f[C]\-\-webtex\f[] option is used, formulas are rendered as
images using Google Charts or other compatible web service, downloaded
and embedded in the e\-book.
Otherwise, they will appear verbatim.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B HTML, Slidy, DZSlides, S5, EPUB
The way math is rendered in HTML will depend on the command\-line
options selected:
.RS
.IP "1." 3
The default is to render TeX math as far as possible using unicode
characters, as with RTF, DocBook, and OpenDocument output.
Formulas are put inside a \f[C]span\f[] with \f[C]class="math"\f[], so
that they may be styled differently from the surrounding text if needed.
.IP "2." 3
If the \f[C]\-\-latexmathml\f[] option is used, TeX math will be
displayed between \f[C]$\f[] or \f[C]$$\f[] characters and put in
\f[C]<span>\f[] tags with class \f[C]LaTeX\f[].
The LaTeXMathML script will be used to render it as formulas.
(This trick does not work in all browsers, but it works in Firefox.
In browsers that do not support LaTeXMathML, TeX math will appear
verbatim between \f[C]$\f[] characters.)
.IP "3." 3
If the \f[C]\-\-jsmath\f[] option is used, TeX math will be put inside
\f[C]<span>\f[] tags (for inline math) or \f[C]<div>\f[] tags (for
display math) with class \f[C]math\f[].
The jsMath script will be used to render it.
.IP "4." 3
If the \f[C]\-\-mimetex\f[] option is used, the mimeTeX CGI script will
be called to generate images for each TeX formula.
This should work in all browsers.
The \f[C]\-\-mimetex\f[] option takes an optional URL as argument.
If no URL is specified, it will be assumed that the mimeTeX CGI script
is at \f[C]/cgi\-bin/mimetex.cgi\f[].
.IP "5." 3
If the \f[C]\-\-gladtex\f[] option is used, TeX formulas will be
enclosed in \f[C]<eq>\f[] tags in the HTML output.
The resulting \f[C]htex\f[] file may then be processed by gladTeX, which
will produce image files for each formula and an \f[C]html\f[] file with
links to these images.
So, the procedure is:
.RS 4
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-s\ \-\-gladtex\ myfile.txt\ \-o\ myfile.htex
gladtex\ \-d\ myfile\-images\ myfile.htex
#\ produces\ myfile.html\ and\ images\ in\ myfile\-images
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.IP "6." 3
If the \f[C]\-\-webtex\f[] option is used, TeX formulas will be
converted to \f[C]<img>\f[] tags that link to an external script that
converts formulas to images.
The formula will be URL\-encoded and concatenated with the URL provided.
If no URL is specified, the Google Chart API will be used
(\f[C]http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=\f[]).
.IP "7." 3
If the \f[C]\-\-mathjax\f[] option is used, TeX math will be displayed
between \f[C]\\(...\\)\f[] (for inline math) or \f[C]\\[...\\]\f[] (for
display math) and put in \f[C]<span>\f[] tags with class \f[C]math\f[].
The MathJax script will be used to render it as formulas.
.RE
.SS Raw HTML
.SS Extension: \f[C]raw_html\f[]
.PP
Markdown allows you to insert raw HTML (or DocBook) anywhere in a
document (except verbatim contexts, where \f[C]<\f[], \f[C]>\f[], and
\f[C]&\f[] are interpreted literally).
(Technically this is not an extension, since standard markdown allows
it, but it has been made an extension so that it can be disabled if
desired.)
.PP
The raw HTML is passed through unchanged in HTML, S5, Slidy, Slideous,
DZSlides, EPUB, Markdown, and Textile output, and suppressed in other
formats.
.SS Extension: \f[C]markdown_in_html_blocks\f[]
.PP
Standard markdown allows you to include HTML "blocks": blocks of HTML
between balanced tags that are separated from the surrounding text with
blank lines, and start and end at the left margin.
Within these blocks, everything is interpreted as HTML, not markdown; so
(for example), \f[C]*\f[] does not signify emphasis.
.PP
Pandoc behaves this way when the \f[C]markdown_strict\f[] format is
used; but by default, pandoc interprets material between HTML block tags
as markdown.
Thus, for example, Pandoc will turn
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<table>
<tr>
<td>*one*</td>
<td>[a\ link](http://google.com)</td>
</tr>
</table>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
into
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<table>
<tr>
<td><em>one</em></td>
<td><a\ href="http://google.com">a\ link</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
whereas \f[C]Markdown.pl\f[] will preserve it as is.
.PP
There is one exception to this rule: text between \f[C]<script>\f[] and
\f[C]<style>\f[] tags is not interpreted as markdown.
.PP
This departure from standard markdown should make it easier to mix
markdown with HTML block elements.
For example, one can surround a block of markdown text with
\f[C]<div>\f[] tags without preventing it from being interpreted as
markdown.
.SS Extension: \f[C]native_divs\f[]
.PP
Use native pandoc \f[C]Div\f[] blocks for content inside \f[C]<div>\f[]
tags.
For the most part this should give the same output as
\f[C]markdown_in_html_blocks\f[], but it makes it easier to write pandoc
filters to manipulate groups of blocks.
.SS Extension: \f[C]native_spans\f[]
.PP
Use native pandoc \f[C]Span\f[] blocks for content inside
\f[C]<span>\f[] tags.
For the most part this should give the same output as \f[C]raw_html\f[],
but it makes it easier to write pandoc filters to manipulate groups of
inlines.
.SS Raw TeX
.SS Extension: \f[C]raw_tex\f[]
.PP
In addition to raw HTML, pandoc allows raw LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt to be
included in a document.
Inline TeX commands will be preserved and passed unchanged to the LaTeX
and ConTeXt writers.
Thus, for example, you can use LaTeX to include BibTeX citations:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This\ result\ was\ proved\ in\ \\cite{jones.1967}.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that in LaTeX environments, like
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\\hline
Age\ &\ Frequency\ \\\\\ \\hline
18\-\-25\ \ &\ 15\ \\\\
26\-\-35\ \ &\ 33\ \\\\
36\-\-45\ \ &\ 22\ \\\\\ \\hline
\\end{tabular}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
the material between the begin and end tags will be interpreted as raw
LaTeX, not as markdown.
.PP
Inline LaTeX is ignored in output formats other than Markdown, LaTeX,
and ConTeXt.
.SS LaTeX macros
.SS Extension: \f[C]latex_macros\f[]
.PP
For output formats other than LaTeX, pandoc will parse LaTeX
\f[C]\\newcommand\f[] and \f[C]\\renewcommand\f[] definitions and apply
the resulting macros to all LaTeX math.
So, for example, the following will work in all output formats, not just
LaTeX:
.PP
⟨\f[I]a\f[], \f[I]b\f[], \f[I]c\f[]⟩
.PP
In LaTeX output, the \f[C]\\newcommand\f[] definition will simply be
passed unchanged to the output.
.SS Links
.PP
Markdown allows links to be specified in several ways.
.SS Automatic links
.PP
If you enclose a URL or email address in pointy brackets, it will become
a link:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<http://google.com>
<sam\@green.eggs.ham>
\f[]
.fi
.SS Inline links
.PP
An inline link consists of the link text in square brackets, followed by
the URL in parentheses.
(Optionally, the URL can be followed by a link title, in quotes.)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
This\ is\ an\ [inline\ link](/url),\ and\ here\[aq]s\ [one\ with
a\ title](http://fsf.org\ "click\ here\ for\ a\ good\ time!").
\f[]
.fi
.PP
There can be no space between the bracketed part and the parenthesized
part.
The link text can contain formatting (such as emphasis), but the title
cannot.
.PP
Email addresses in inline links are not autodetected, so they have to be
prefixed with \f[C]mailto\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[Write\ me!](mailto:sam\@green.eggs.ham)
\f[]
.fi
.SS Reference links
.PP
An \f[I]explicit\f[] reference link has two parts, the link itself and
the link definition, which may occur elsewhere in the document (either
before or after the link).
.PP
The link consists of link text in square brackets, followed by a label
in square brackets.
(There can be space between the two.) The link definition consists of
the bracketed label, followed by a colon and a space, followed by the
URL, and optionally (after a space) a link title either in quotes or in
parentheses.
The label must not be parseable as a citation (assuming the
\f[C]citations\f[] extension is enabled): citations take precedence over
link labels.
.PP
Here are some examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[my\ label\ 1]:\ /foo/bar.html\ \ "My\ title,\ optional"
[my\ label\ 2]:\ /foo
[my\ label\ 3]:\ http://fsf.org\ (The\ free\ software\ foundation)
[my\ label\ 4]:\ /bar#special\ \ \[aq]A\ title\ in\ single\ quotes\[aq]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The URL may optionally be surrounded by angle brackets:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[my\ label\ 5]:\ <http://foo.bar.baz>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The title may go on the next line:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[my\ label\ 3]:\ http://fsf.org
\ \ "The\ free\ software\ foundation"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that link labels are not case sensitive.
So, this will work:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Here\ is\ [my\ link][FOO]

[Foo]:\ /bar/baz
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In an \f[I]implicit\f[] reference link, the second pair of brackets is
empty:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
See\ [my\ website][].

[my\ website]:\ http://foo.bar.baz
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note: In \f[C]Markdown.pl\f[] and most other markdown implementations,
reference link definitions cannot occur in nested constructions such as
list items or block quotes.
Pandoc lifts this arbitrary seeming restriction.
So the following is fine in pandoc, though not in most other
implementations:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>\ My\ block\ [quote].
>
>\ [quote]:\ /foo
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]shortcut_reference_links\f[]
.PP
In a \f[I]shortcut\f[] reference link, the second pair of brackets may
be omitted entirely:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
See\ [my\ website].

[my\ website]:\ http://foo.bar.baz
\f[]
.fi
.SS Internal links
.PP
To link to another section of the same document, use the automatically
generated identifier (see Header identifiers, below).
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
See\ the\ [Introduction](#introduction).
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
See\ the\ [Introduction].

[Introduction]:\ #introduction
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Internal links are currently supported for HTML formats (including HTML
slide shows and EPUB), LaTeX, and ConTeXt.
.SS Images
.PP
A link immediately preceded by a \f[C]!\f[] will be treated as an image.
The link text will be used as the image\[aq]s alt text:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
![la\ lune](lalune.jpg\ "Voyage\ to\ the\ moon")

![movie\ reel]

[movie\ reel]:\ movie.gif
\f[]
.fi
.SS Extension: \f[C]implicit_figures\f[]
.PP
An image occurring by itself in a paragraph will be rendered as a figure
with a caption. (In LaTeX, a figure environment will be used; in HTML,
the image will be placed in a \f[C]div\f[] with class \f[C]figure\f[],
together with a caption in a \f[C]p\f[] with class \f[C]caption\f[].)
The image\[aq]s alt text will be used as the caption.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
![This\ is\ the\ caption](/url/of/image.png)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you just want a regular inline image, just make sure it is not the
only thing in the paragraph.
One way to do this is to insert a nonbreaking space after the image:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
![This\ image\ won\[aq]t\ be\ a\ figure](/url/of/image.png)\\
\f[]
.fi
.SS Footnotes
.SS Extension: \f[C]footnotes\f[]
.PP
Pandoc\[aq]s markdown allows footnotes, using the following syntax:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Here\ is\ a\ footnote\ reference,[^1]\ and\ another.[^longnote]

[^1]:\ Here\ is\ the\ footnote.

[^longnote]:\ Here\[aq]s\ one\ with\ multiple\ blocks.

\ \ \ \ Subsequent\ paragraphs\ are\ indented\ to\ show\ that\ they
belong\ to\ the\ previous\ footnote.

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\ some.code\ }

\ \ \ \ The\ whole\ paragraph\ can\ be\ indented,\ or\ just\ the\ first
\ \ \ \ line.\ \ In\ this\ way,\ multi\-paragraph\ footnotes\ work\ like
\ \ \ \ multi\-paragraph\ list\ items.

This\ paragraph\ won\[aq]t\ be\ part\ of\ the\ note,\ because\ it
isn\[aq]t\ indented.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The identifiers in footnote references may not contain spaces, tabs, or
newlines.
These identifiers are used only to correlate the footnote reference with
the note itself; in the output, footnotes will be numbered sequentially.
.PP
The footnotes themselves need not be placed at the end of the document.
They may appear anywhere except inside other block elements (lists,
block quotes, tables, etc.).
.SS Extension: \f[C]inline_notes\f[]
.PP
Inline footnotes are also allowed (though, unlike regular notes, they
cannot contain multiple paragraphs).
The syntax is as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Here\ is\ an\ inline\ note.^[Inlines\ notes\ are\ easier\ to\ write,\ since
you\ don\[aq]t\ have\ to\ pick\ an\ identifier\ and\ move\ down\ to\ type\ the
note.]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Inline and regular footnotes may be mixed freely.
.SS Citations
.SS Extension: \f[C]citations\f[]
.PP
Using an external filter, \f[C]pandoc\-citeproc\f[], pandoc can
automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of
styles.
Basic usage is
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-\-filter\ pandoc\-citeproc\ myinput.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In order to use this feature, you will need to specify a bibliography
file using the \f[C]bibliography\f[] metadata field in a YAML metadata
section, or \f[C]\-\-bibliography\f[] command line argument.
You can supply multiple \f[C]\-\-bibliography\f[] arguments or set
\f[C]bibliography\f[] metadata field to YAML array, if you want to use
multiple bibliography files.
The bibliography may have any of these formats:
.PP
.TS

.PP
Note that \f[C]\&.bib\f[] can generally be used with both BibTeX and
BibLaTeX files, but you can use \f[C]\&.bibtex\f[] to force BibTeX.
.PP
Note that \f[C]pandoc\-citeproc\ \-\-bib2json\f[] and
\f[C]pandoc\-citeproc\ \-\-bib2yaml\f[] can produce \f[C]\&.json\f[] and
\f[C]\&.yaml\f[] files from any of the supported formats.
.PP
In\-field markup: In bibtex and biblatex databases, pandoc\-citeproc
parses (a subset of) LaTeX markup; in CSL JSON databases, an HTML\-like
markup (specs); and in CSL YAML databases, pandoc markdown.
\f[C]pandoc\-citeproc\ \-j\f[] and \f[C]\-y\f[] interconvert these
markup formats as far as possible.
.PP
As an alternative to specifying a bibliography file, you can include the
citation data directly in the \f[C]references\f[] field of the
document\[aq]s YAML metadata.
The field should contain an array of YAML\-encoded references, for
example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-\-
references:
\-\ type:\ article\-journal
\ \ id:\ WatsonCrick1953

\f[]
.fi
.PP
(\f[C]pandoc\-citeproc\ \-\-bib2yaml\f[] can produce these from a
bibliography file in one of the supported formats.)
.PP
By default, \f[C]pandoc\-citeproc\f[] will use the Chicago Manual of
Style author\-date format for citations and references.
To use another style, you will need to specify a CSL 1.0 style file in
the \f[C]csl\f[] metadata field.
A repository of CSL styles can be found at
https://github.com/citation\-style\-language/styles.
See also http://zotero.org/styles for easy browsing.
A primer on creating and modifying CSL styles can be found at
http://citationstyles.org/downloads/primer.html.
.PP
Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons.
Each citation must have a key, composed of \[aq]\@\[aq] + the citation
identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a
locator, and a suffix.
The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or \f[C]_\f[], and may
contain alphanumerics, \f[C]_\f[], and internal punctuation characters
(\f[C]:.#$%&\-+?<>~/\f[]).
Here are some examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Blah\ blah\ [see\ \@doe99,\ pp.\ 33\-35;\ also\ \@smith04,\ ch.\ 1].

Blah\ blah\ [\@doe99,\ pp.\ 33\-35,\ 38\-39\ and\ *passim*].

Blah\ blah\ [\@smith04;\ \@doe99].
\f[]
.fi
.PP
A minus sign (\f[C]\-\f[]) before the \f[C]\@\f[] will suppress mention
of the author in the citation.
This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Smith\ says\ blah\ [\-\@smith04].
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You can also write an in\-text citation, as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\@smith04\ says\ blah.

\@smith04\ [p.\ 33]\ says\ blah.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If the style calls for a list of works cited, it will be placed at the
end of the document.
Normally, you will want to end your document with an appropriate header:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
last\ paragraph...

#\ References
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The bibliography will be inserted after this header.
Note that the \f[C]unnumbered\f[] class will be added to this header, so
that the section will not be numbered.
.PP
If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing
them in the body text, you can define a dummy \f[C]nocite\f[] metadata
field and put the citations there:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-\-
nocite:\ |
\ \ \@item1,\ \@item2
\&...

\@item3
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In this example, the document will contain a citation for \f[C]item3\f[]
only, but the bibliography will contain entries for \f[C]item1\f[],
\f[C]item2\f[], and \f[C]item3\f[].
.PP
For LaTeX or PDF output, you can also use NatBib or BibLaTeX to render
bibliography.
In order to do so, specify bibliography files as outlined above, and add
\f[C]\-\-natbib\f[] or \f[C]\-\-biblatex\f[] argument to \f[C]pandoc\f[]
invocation.
Bear in mind that bibliography files have to be in respective format
(either BibTeX or BibLaTeX).
.SS Non\-pandoc extensions
.PP
The following markdown syntax extensions are not enabled by default in
pandoc, but may be enabled by adding \f[C]+EXTENSION\f[] to the format
name, where \f[C]EXTENSION\f[] is the name of the extension.
Thus, for example, \f[C]markdown+hard_line_breaks\f[] is markdown with
hard line breaks.
.SS Extension: \f[C]lists_without_preceding_blankline\f[]
.PP
Allow a list to occur right after a paragraph, with no intervening blank
space.
.SS Extension: \f[C]hard_line_breaks\f[]
.PP
Causes all newlines within a paragraph to be interpreted as hard line
breaks instead of spaces.
.SS Extension: \f[C]ignore_line_breaks\f[]
.PP
Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being
treated as spaces or as hard line breaks.
This option is intended for use with East Asian languages where spaces
are not used between words, but text is divided into lines for
readability.
.SS Extension: \f[C]tex_math_single_backslash\f[]
.PP
Causes anything between \f[C]\\(\f[] and \f[C]\\)\f[] to be interpreted
as inline TeX math, and anything between \f[C]\\[\f[] and \f[C]\\]\f[]
to be interpreted as display TeX math.
Note: a drawback of this extension is that it precludes escaping
\f[C](\f[] and \f[C][\f[].
.SS Extension: \f[C]tex_math_double_backslash\f[]
.PP
Causes anything between \f[C]\\\\(\f[] and \f[C]\\\\)\f[] to be
interpreted as inline TeX math, and anything between \f[C]\\\\[\f[] and
\f[C]\\\\]\f[] to be interpreted as display TeX math.
.SS Extension: \f[C]markdown_attribute\f[]
.PP
By default, pandoc interprets material inside block\-level tags as
markdown.
This extension changes the behavior so that markdown is only parsed
inside block\-level tags if the tags have the attribute
\f[C]markdown=1\f[].
.SS Extension: \f[C]mmd_title_block\f[]
.PP
Enables a MultiMarkdown style title block at the top of the document,
for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Title:\ \ \ My\ title
Author:\ \ John\ Doe
Date:\ \ \ \ September\ 1,\ 2008
Comment:\ This\ is\ a\ sample\ mmd\ title\ block,\ with
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a\ field\ spanning\ multiple\ lines.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
See the MultiMarkdown documentation for details.
If \f[C]pandoc_title_block\f[] or \f[C]yaml_metadata_block\f[] is
enabled, it will take precedence over \f[C]mmd_title_block\f[].
.SS Extension: \f[C]abbreviations\f[]
.PP
Parses PHP Markdown Extra abbreviation keys, like
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*[HTML]:\ Hyper\ Text\ Markup\ Language
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that the pandoc document model does not support abbreviations, so
if this extension is enabled, abbreviation keys are simply skipped (as
opposed to being parsed as paragraphs).
.SS Extension: \f[C]autolink_bare_uris\f[]
.PP
Makes all absolute URIs into links, even when not surrounded by pointy
braces \f[C]<...>\f[].
.SS Extension: \f[C]ascii_identifiers\f[]
.PP
Causes the identifiers produced by \f[C]auto_identifiers\f[] to be pure
ASCII.
Accents are stripped off of accented latin letters, and non\-latin
letters are omitted.
.SS Extension: \f[C]link_attributes\f[]
.PP
Parses multimarkdown style key\-value attributes on link and image
references.
Note that pandoc\[aq]s internal document model provides nowhere to put
these, so they are presently just ignored.
.SS Extension: \f[C]mmd_header_identifiers\f[]
.PP
Parses multimarkdown style header identifiers (in square brackets, after
the header but before any trailing \f[C]#\f[]s in an ATX header).
.SS Extension: \f[C]compact_definition_lists\f[]
.PP
Activates the definition list syntax of pandoc 1.12.x and earlier.
This syntax differs from the one described above in several respects:
.IP \[bu] 2
No blank line is required between consecutive items of the definition
list.
.IP \[bu] 2
To get a "tight" or "compact" list, omit space between consecutive
items; the space between a term and its definition does not affect
anything.
.IP \[bu] 2
Lazy wrapping of paragraphs is not allowed: the entire definition must
be indented four spaces.
.SS Markdown variants
.PP
In addition to pandoc\[aq]s extended markdown, the following markdown
variants are supported:
.TP
.B \f[C]markdown_phpextra\f[] (PHP Markdown Extra)
\f[C]footnotes\f[], \f[C]pipe_tables\f[], \f[C]raw_html\f[],
\f[C]markdown_attribute\f[], \f[C]fenced_code_blocks\f[],

.SS Extensions with formats other than markdown
.PP
Some of the extensions discussed above can be used with formats other
than markdown:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]auto_identifiers\f[] can be used with \f[C]latex\f[], \f[C]rst\f[],
\f[C]mediawiki\f[], and \f[C]textile\f[] input (and is used by default).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]tex_math_dollars\f[], \f[C]tex_math_single_backslash\f[], and
\f[C]tex_math_double_backslash\f[] can be used with \f[C]html\f[] input.
(This is handy for reading web pages formatted using MathJax, for
example.)
.SH PRODUCING SLIDE SHOWS WITH PANDOC
.PP
You can use Pandoc to produce an HTML + javascript slide presentation
that can be viewed via a web browser.
There are five ways to do this, using S5, DZSlides, Slidy, Slideous, or
reveal.js.
You can also produce a PDF slide show using LaTeX beamer.
.PP
Here\[aq]s the markdown source for a simple slide show,
\f[C]habits.txt\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%\ Habits
%\ John\ Doe
%\ March\ 22,\ 2005

#\ In\ the\ morning

##\ Getting\ up

\-\ Turn\ off\ alarm
\-\ Get\ out\ of\ bed

##\ Breakfast

\-\ Eat\ eggs
\-\ Drink\ coffee

#\ In\ the\ evening

##\ Dinner

\-\ Eat\ spaghetti
\-\ Drink\ wine

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

![picture\ of\ spaghetti](images/spaghetti.jpg)

##\ Going\ to\ sleep

\-\ Get\ in\ bed
\-\ Count\ sheep
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To produce an HTML/javascript slide show, simply type
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-t\ FORMAT\ \-s\ habits.txt\ \-o\ habits.html
\f[]
.fi
.PP
where \f[C]FORMAT\f[] is either \f[C]s5\f[], \f[C]slidy\f[],
\f[C]slideous\f[], \f[C]dzslides\f[], or \f[C]revealjs\f[].
.PP
For Slidy, Slideous, reveal.js, and S5, the file produced by pandoc with
the \f[C]\-s/\-\-standalone\f[] option embeds a link to javascripts and
CSS files, which are assumed to be available at the relative path
\f[C]s5/default\f[] (for S5), \f[C]slideous\f[] (for Slideous),
\f[C]reveal.js\f[] (for reveal.js), or at the Slidy website at
\f[C]w3.org\f[] (for Slidy).
(These paths can be changed by setting the \f[C]slidy\-url\f[],
\f[C]slideous\-url\f[], \f[C]revealjs\-url\f[], or \f[C]s5\-url\f[]
variables; see \f[C]\-\-variable\f[], above.) For DZSlides, the
(relatively short) javascript and css are included in the file by
default.
.PP
With all HTML slide formats, the \f[C]\-\-self\-contained\f[] option can
be used to produce a single file that contains all of the data necessary
to display the slide show, including linked scripts, stylesheets,
images, and videos.
.PP
To produce a PDF slide show using beamer, type
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-t\ beamer\ habits.txt\ \-o\ habits.pdf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that a reveal.js slide show can also be converted to a PDF by
printing it to a file from the browser.
.SS Structuring the slide show
.PP
By default, the \f[I]slide level\f[] is the highest header level in the
hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another
header, somewhere in the document.
In the example above, level 1 headers are always followed by level 2
headers, which are followed by content, so 2 is the slide level.
This default can be overridden using the \f[C]\-\-slide\-level\f[]
option.
.PP
The document is carved up into slides according to the following rules:
.IP \[bu] 2
A horizontal rule always starts a new slide.
.IP \[bu] 2
A header at the slide level always starts a new slide.
.IP \[bu] 2
Headers \f[I]below\f[] the slide level in the hierarchy create headers
\f[I]within\f[] a slide.
.IP \[bu] 2
Headers \f[I]above\f[] the slide level in the hierarchy create "title
slides," which just contain the section title and help to break the
slide show into sections.
.IP \[bu] 2
A title page is constructed automatically from the document\[aq]s title
block, if present.
(In the case of beamer, this can be disabled by commenting out some
lines in the default template.)
.PP
These rules are designed to support many different styles of slide show.
If you don\[aq]t care about structuring your slides into sections and
subsections, you can just use level 1 headers for all each slide.
(In that case, level 1 will be the slide level.) But you can also
structure the slide show into sections, as in the example above.
.PP
Note: in reveal.js slide shows, if slide level is 2, a two\-dimensional
layout will be produced, with level 1 headers building horizontally and
level 2 headers building vertically.
It is not recommended that you use deeper nesting of section levels with
reveal.js.
.SS Incremental lists
.PP
By default, these writers produce lists that display "all at once." If
you want your lists to display incrementally (one item at a time), use
the \f[C]\-i\f[] option.
If you want a particular list to depart from the default (that is, to
display incrementally without the \f[C]\-i\f[] option and all at once
with the \f[C]\-i\f[] option), put it in a block quote:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>\ \-\ Eat\ spaghetti
>\ \-\ Drink\ wine
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In this way incremental and nonincremental lists can be mixed in a
single document.
.SS Inserting pauses
.PP
You can add "pauses" within a slide by including a paragraph containing
three dots, separated by spaces:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ Slide\ with\ a\ pause

content\ before\ the\ pause

\&.\ .\ .

content\ after\ the\ pause
\f[]
.fi
.SS Styling the slides
.PP
You can change the style of HTML slides by putting customized CSS files
in \f[C]$DATADIR/s5/default\f[] (for S5), \f[C]$DATADIR/slidy\f[] (for
Slidy), or \f[C]$DATADIR/slideous\f[] (for Slideous), where
\f[C]$DATADIR\f[] is the user data directory (see
\f[C]\-\-data\-dir\f[], above).
The originals may be found in pandoc\[aq]s system data directory
(generally \f[C]$CABALDIR/pandoc\-VERSION/s5/default\f[]).
Pandoc will look there for any files it does not find in the user data
directory.
.PP
For dzslides, the CSS is included in the HTML file itself, and may be
modified there.
.PP
For reveal.js, themes can be used by setting the \f[C]theme\f[]
variable, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-V\ theme=moon
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Or you can specify a custom stylesheet using the \f[C]\-\-css\f[]
option.
.PP
To style beamer slides, you can specify a beamer "theme" or "colortheme"
using the \f[C]\-V\f[] option:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-t\ beamer\ habits.txt\ \-V\ theme:Warsaw\ \-o\ habits.pdf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that header attributes will turn into slide attributes (on a
\f[C]<div>\f[] or \f[C]<section>\f[]) in HTML slide formats, allowing
you to style individual slides.
In Beamer, the only header attribute that affects slides is the
\f[C]allowframebreaks\f[] class, which sets the
\f[C]allowframebreaks\f[] option, causing multiple slides to be created
if the content overfills the frame.
This is recommended especially for bibliographies:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ References\ {.allowframebreaks}
\f[]
.fi
.SS Speaker notes
.PP
reveal.js has good support for speaker notes.
You can add notes to your markdown document thus:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<div\ class="notes">
This\ is\ my\ note.

\-\ It\ can\ contain\ markdown
\-\ like\ this\ list

</div>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To show the notes window, press \f[C]s\f[] while viewing the
presentation.
Notes are not yet supported for other slide formats, but the notes will
not appear on the slides themselves.
.SS Marking frames "fragile" in beamer
.PP
Sometimes it is necessary to add the LaTeX \f[C][fragile]\f[] option to
a frame in beamer (for example, when using the \f[C]minted\f[]
environment).
This can be forced by adding the \f[C]fragile\f[] class to the header
introducing the slide:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ Fragile\ slide\ {.fragile}
\f[]
.fi
.SH EPUB METADATA
.PP
EPUB metadata may be specified using the \f[C]\-\-epub\-metadata\f[]
option, but if the source document is markdown, it is better to use a
YAML metadata block.
Here is an example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-\-
title:
\-\ type:\ main
\ \ text:\ My\ Book
\-\ type:\ subtitle
\ \ text:\ An\ investigation\ of\ metadata

.SH LITERATE HASKELL SUPPORT
.PP
If you append \f[C]+lhs\f[] (or \f[C]+literate_haskell\f[]) to an
appropriate input or output format (\f[C]markdown\f[],
\f[C]markdown_strict\f[], \f[C]rst\f[], or \f[C]latex\f[] for input or
output; \f[C]beamer\f[], \f[C]html\f[] or \f[C]html5\f[] for output
only), pandoc will treat the document as literate Haskell source.
This means that
.IP \[bu] 2
In markdown input, "bird track" sections will be parsed as Haskell code
rather than block quotations.
Text between \f[C]\\begin{code}\f[] and \f[C]\\end{code}\f[] will also
be treated as Haskell code.
.IP \[bu] 2
In markdown output, code blocks with classes \f[C]haskell\f[] and
\f[C]literate\f[] will be rendered using bird tracks, and block
quotations will be indented one space, so they will not be treated as
Haskell code.
In addition, headers will be rendered setext\-style (with underlines)
rather than atx\-style (with \[aq]#\[aq] characters).
(This is because ghc treats \[aq]#\[aq] characters in column 1 as
introducing line numbers.)
.IP \[bu] 2
In restructured text input, "bird track" sections will be parsed as
Haskell code.
.IP \[bu] 2
In restructured text output, code blocks with class \f[C]haskell\f[]
will be rendered using bird tracks.
.IP \[bu] 2
In LaTeX input, text in \f[C]code\f[] environments will be parsed as
Haskell code.
.IP \[bu] 2
In LaTeX output, code blocks with class \f[C]haskell\f[] will be
rendered inside \f[C]code\f[] environments.
.IP \[bu] 2
In HTML output, code blocks with class \f[C]haskell\f[] will be rendered
with class \f[C]literatehaskell\f[] and bird tracks.
.PP
Examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-f\ markdown+lhs\ \-t\ html
\f[]
.fi
.PP
reads literate Haskell source formatted with markdown conventions and
writes ordinary HTML (without bird tracks).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-f\ markdown+lhs\ \-t\ html+lhs
\f[]
.fi
.PP
writes HTML with the Haskell code in bird tracks, so it can be copied
and pasted as literate Haskell source.
.SH SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
.PP
Pandoc will automatically highlight syntax in fenced code blocks that
are marked with a language name.
(See [Extension: \f[C]inline_code_attributes\f[]] and [Extension:
\f[C]fenced_code_attributes\f[]], above.) The Haskell library
highlighting\-kate is used for highlighting, which works in HTML, Docx,
and LaTeX/PDF output.
The color scheme can be selected using the \f[C]\-\-highlight\-style\f[]
option.
The default color scheme is \f[C]pygments\f[], which imitates the
default color scheme used by the Python library pygments, but pygments
is not actually used to do the highlighting.
.PP
To see a list of language names that pandoc will recognize, type
\f[C]pandoc\ \-\-version\f[].
.PP
To disable highlighting, use the \f[C]\-\-no\-highlight\f[] option.
.SH CUSTOM WRITERS
.PP
Pandoc can be extended with custom writers written in lua.
(Pandoc includes a lua interpreter, so lua need not be installed
separately.)
.PP
To use a custom writer, simply specify the path to the lua script in
place of the output format.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-t\ data/sample.lua
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Creating a custom writer requires writing a lua function for each
possible element in a pandoc document.
To get a documented example which you can modify according to your
needs, do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pandoc\ \-\-print\-default\-data\-file\ sample.lua
