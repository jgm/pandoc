Pandoc aspires to be the swiss army knife of text markup formats: it
can read markdown and (with some limitations) HTML, LaTeX, and
reStructuredText, and it can write markdown, reStructuredText, HTML,
DocBook XML, OpenDocument XML, ODT, RTF, groff man, MediaWiki markup,
GNU Texinfo, LaTeX, ConTeXt, EPUB, Slidy, and S5.  Pandoc's markdown syntax includes
extensions for LaTeX math, tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more.

Since the last report, two new output formats have been added:
EPUB and Slidy HTML slide shows.  Now it is possible to write
a book in markdown and produce an ebook with a single command!
New markdown extensions include grid tables and example lists that are
sequentially numbered throughout a document.
