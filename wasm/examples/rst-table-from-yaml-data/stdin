        from Maine through New Jersey, and are also common offshore to
        depths of 2,300 feet from Maine through North Carolina.

  bycatch: |

  availability: |
    Year-round. In New England, where most lobsters are landed, the peak
    harvest season extends from May to November.
  research: |
    -   State scientists, in cooperation with the lobster industry, are
        conducting projects to assist with the effective management of the
        lobster resource. Many states have established [ventless trap
        survey](http://www.asmfc.org/fisheries-science/surveys)s to quantify
        the abundance of juvenile lobsters. By removing escape vents from
        the lobster traps and randomly placing those traps within certain
        depth categories and geographic areas, researchers can assess the
        abundance of juvenile lobsters and the potential for young lobsters
        to reach a size or life stage that can be caught by the fishing gear
        (recruitment) in the future. These surveys complement longstanding
        fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys conducted by NOAA Fisheries
        and the states. Because trawl gear cannot effectively sample rocky
        or shallow coastal bottom types, the ventless trap surveys attempt
        to fill this data gap by using fixed lobster gear without escape
        vents.

    Lobster is low in saturated fat and is a very good source of protein and

    [advises](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/ucm252395.pdf)
    consumers to not eat the tomalley, the light-green substance found in
    the lobster.

        conducted by the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
        Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/) (ASMFC), there is record high
        stock abundance and recruitment in the Gulf of Maine and Georges
        Bank, and record low abundance and recruitment failure in Southern
        New England. The Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank stock is not
        overfished. However, the ASMFC considers the Southern New England
        stock severely depleted due to environmental factors and fishing
        pressure. Neither stock is subject to overfishing.
    -   Since 2012, [Young of Year
        surveys](http://umaine.edu/wahlelab/american-lobster-settlement-index-alsi/american-lobster-settlement-index/)
        in the Gulf of Maine and George’s Bank stock have shown consistent
