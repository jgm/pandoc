This document describes pandoc's handling of [JATS].

Metadata Values
===============

`abstract`
:   Article summary. Added via the document's front matter via the
    [`<abstract>`][elem:abstract] element.

`author`
:   list of article contributors. Each author should have a surname
    and a given name listed in the entry; if the author has no
    `surname` value, then the item will be used as the contributors
    [`string-name`][elem:string-name].

    `orcid`
    :   the contributor's ORCID identifier.

    `surname`
    :   surname of the contributor. Usually the family name in
        western names.

        See [`<surname>`][elem:surname].

    `given-names`
    :   personal names of the contributor; this includes middle
        names (if any) in western-style names.

        See [`<given-names>`][elem:given-names].

    `name`
    :   full name of the author; included only as a fallback if
        `author.surname` is not available. Tagged with
        [`<string-name>`][elem:string-name].

    `email`
    :   the contributor's email address.

        Used as the contents of the [`<email>`][elem:given-names]
        element.

    `affiliation`
    :   either full affiliation entries as described in field
        `affiliation`, or a list of affiliation identifiers.

        The identifiers link to the organizations with which an
        author is affiliated. Each identifier in this list must
        also occur as the `id` of an affiliation listed in the
        top-level `affiliation` list.

        If the top-level `affiliation` field is set, then this
        entry assumed to be a list of identifiers, and a list of
        full entries if that field is unset.

        Full entries must be given if the articleauthoring tag
        set it used, as affiliation links are not allowed in that
        schema.

    `equal-contrib`
    :   boolean attribute used to mark authors who contributed
        equally to the work. The
        [`equal-contrib`][attr:equal-contrib] attribute, set to
        `yes`, is added to the author's [`<contrib>`] element if
        this is set to a truthy value.

    `cor-id`
    :   identifier linking to the contributor's correspondence
        information. The info itself must be stored as an item in
        `article.author-notes.corresp`. If the `cor-id` value is
        set, then an [`<xref>`][elem:xref] link of
        [`ref-type`][attr:ref-type] `corresp` is added. The
        [`rid`][attr:rid] attribute is set to `cor-<ID>`, where
        `<ID>` is the stringified value of this attribute.

        Furthermore, the [`corresp`][attr:corresp] attribute on
        the author's [`<contrib>`] element is set to `yes` if
        this attribute is set to a truthy.

`affiliation`
:   the list of organizations with which contributors are
    affiliated. Each institution is added as an [`<aff>`] element to
    the author's contrib-group.

    The fields are given in the order in which they are included in
    the output.

    `id`
    :   internal identifier; used as the [`<aff>`] element's `id`
        value, prefixed with `aff-`.

    `group`
    :   name of the research group or other low-level organizational
        structure; used as value of an [`<institution>`] element with
        [`content-type`][attr:content-type] set to `group`.

    `department`
    :   name of the department or other mid-level organizational
        structure; used as value of an [`<institution>`] element with
        [`content-type`][attr:content-type] set to `dept`.

    `organization`
    :   name of the company, university, or other top-level
        organizational structure; used as value of an
        [`<institution>`] element. The institution element is wrapped
        in an [`<institution-wrap>`] element; any identifiers, like
        `ringgold` or `ror`, are added to the wrapper and must hence
        belong to this organization (not the department or group).

    `isni`
    :   International Standard Name Identifier of the organization.
        Added via an [`<institution-id>`] element with
        [`institution-id-type`](attr:institution-id-type) set to
        `ISNI`.

    `ringgold`
    :   [Ringgold] identifier of the organization. Added via an
        [`<institution-id>`] element with
        [`institution-id-type`](attr:institution-id-type) set to
        `Ringgold`.

    `ror`
    :   Research Organization Registry identifier of the
        organization. Added via an [`<institution-id>`] element with
        [`institution-id-type`](attr:institution-id-type) set to
        `ROR`.

    `pid`
    :   Array of persistent identifiers which are added as
        [`<institution-id>`] elements. Each item must contain a map
        with keys `type`, used as
        [`institution-id-type`](attr:institution-id-type), and `id`,
        used as element content.

    `street-address`
    :   The organization's street address; each list item is wrapped
        in an [`<addr-line>`] element, separated by a comma and
        space (`, `).

    `city`
    :   City in which the organization is located; used only if
        `street-address` is not given, in which case the value is
        wrapped in a [`<city>`] element.

    `country`
    :   Country in which the organization is located; used as the
        value of a [`<country>`] element.

    `country-code`
    :   Two letter ISO-3166-1 country identifier; used as the
        [`country`][attr:country] attribute in element [`<country>`]
        (if the latter is present).

`copyright`
:   Copyright and licensing information. This information is
    rendered via the [`<permissions>`][elem:permissions] element.

    It is recommended to use the `license` field (described below)
    for licensing information. If licensing information is
    included below `copyright`, then the variables `type`, `link`,
    and `text` should always be used together.

    `statement`
    :   copyright notice or statement; used as content of the
        [`<copyright-statement>`][elem:copyright-statement]. Use a
        list for multiple statements.

    `year`
    :   the year of copyright; used as content of the
        [`<copyright-year>`][elem:copyright-year]. Use a list to
        for multiple copyright years. The JATS documentation
        states that this field need not to be used if the year is
        included in the copyright statement.

    `holder`
    :   the copyright holder; included via the
        [`<copyright-holder>`][elem:copyright-holder] element. Use
        a list for multiple copyright holders.

    `text`
    :   inline text setting the license under which the text is
        published; included via the
        [`<license-p>`][elem:copyright-holder] element.

    `type`
    :   type of the license; used as value of the
        [`license-type`][attr:license-type] attribute.

    `link`
    :   external link describing the license; used as value of a
        `xlink:href` attribute in the `<license>` element.

`date`
:   publication date. This value should usually be a string
    representation of a date. Pandoc will parse and deconstruct the
    date into the components given below. It is also possible to
    pass these components directly.

    The publication date is recorded in the document via the
    [`<pub-date>`] element and its sub-elements. The
    [`publication-format`][attr:publication-format] attribute is
    always set to `electronic`.

    `iso-8601`
    :   ISO-8601 representation of the publication date. Used as the
        value of the [`<pub-date>`] element's
        [`iso-8601-date`][attr:iso-8601-date] attribute.

        This value is set automatically if pandoc can parse the
        `date` value as a date.

    `day`, `month`, `year`
    :   Day, month, and year of the publication date. Only the
        publication year is required. The values are used as the
        contents of the elements with the respective names.

        The values are set automatically if pandoc can parse the
        `date` value as a date.

    `type`
    :   The type of event marked by this date. The value is set as
        the [`date-type`][attr:date-type] attribute on the
        [`<pub-date>`] element and defaults to "pub" if not
        specified.

Required Metadata
-----------------

Pandoc will try to generate a valid JATS document even when
information is missing, filling in placeholders or using empty
values. This circumvents the intend to ensure a minimum set of
information being present in documents of a certain tag set. It is
hence recommended to always provide the information listed below.

### Publishing Tag Set

Required metadata values:

- One or more of `journal.publisher-id`, `journal.nlm-ta`,
  `journal.pmc`.
- One or more of `journal.pissn`, `journal.eissn`.
