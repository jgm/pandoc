# SYNOPSIS

`pandoc-lua` [*options*] [*script* [*args*]]

# DESCRIPTION

`pandoc-lua` is a standalone Lua interpreter with behavior similar
to that of the standard `lua` executable, but exposing all of
pandoc's Lua libraries. All `pandoc.*` packages, as well as the
packages `re` and `lpeg`, are available via global variables.
Furthermore, the globals `PANDOC_VERSION`, `PANDOC_STATE`, and
`PANDOC_API_VERSION` are set at startup.

If no script argument is given, then the script is assumed to be
passed in via *stdin*. Interactive mode is not supported at this
time.

# OPTIONS

`-e stat`
:   Execute statement `stat`.

`-l mod`
:   If mod has the pattern `g=m`, then require library `m` into
    global `g`; otherwise require library `mod` into global
    `mod`.

`-v`
:   Show version information.

`-i`, `-E`, `-W`
:    Not supported yet; print a warning to that effect.
