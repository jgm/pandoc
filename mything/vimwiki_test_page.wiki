5.1. Typefaces                                      *vimwiki-syntax-typefaces*

There are a few typefaces that give you a bit of control over how your text
is decorated: 

  *bold text*
  _italic text_
  strikeout text
  `code (no syntax) text`
  super^script^
  sub,,script,,


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2. Links                                              *vimwiki-syntax-links*

Wikilinks

Plain link: 
  [[This is a link]]
With description: 
  [[This is a link source|Description of the link]]

Wiki files don't need to be in the root directory of your wiki, you can put
them in subdirectories as well: 
   [[projects/Important Project 1]]
To jump from that file back to the index file, use this link: 
   [[../index]]
or: 
   [[/index]]
The latter works because wiki links starting with "/" are considered to be
absolute to the wiki root directory, that is, the link [[/index]] always opens
the file /path/to/your/wiki/index.wiki, no matter in which subdirectory you
are currently in.

Links to subdirectories inside the wiki directory are also supported. They
end with a "/": 
  [[a subdirectory/|Other files]]
Use |g:vimwiki_dir_link| to control the behavior when opening directories.

Typing wikilinks can be simplified by using Vim's omni completion (see
|compl-omni|) like so: 
  [[indC-XC-O
which opens up a popup menu with all the wiki files starting with "ind".

When |vimwiki-option-maxhi| equals 1, a distinct highlighting style is used to
identify wikilinks whose targets are not found.

Interwiki:

If you maintain more than one wiki, you can create interwiki links between
them by adding a numbered prefix "wikiX:" in front of a link: 
  [[wiki1:This is a link]]
or: 
  [[wiki1:This is a link source|Description of the link]]

The number behind "wiki" is in the range 0..N-1 and identifies the destination
wiki in |g:vimwiki_list|.

Anchors

A wikilink, interwiki link or diary link can be followed by a '#' and the name
of an anchor.  When opening a link, the cursor jumps to the anchor. 
  [[Todo List#Tomorrow|Tasks for tomorrow]]

To jump inside the current wiki file you can omit the file: 
  [[#Tomorrow]]

See |vimwiki-anchors| for how to set an anchor.

Raw URLs

Raw URLs are also supported: 
  https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki.git
  mailto:habamax@gmail.com
  ftp://vim.org

External files

The "file:" and "local:" schemes allow you to directly link to arbitray
resources using absolute or relative paths: 
  [[file:/home/somebody/a/b/c/music.mp3]]
  [[file:C:/Users/somebody/d/e/f/music.mp3]]
  [[file:/a/b/c/music.mp3]]
  [[file:../assets/data.csv|Important Data]]
  [[local:C:/Users/somebody/d/e/f/music.mp3]]
  [[file:/home/user/documents/|Link to a directory]]

These links are opened with the system command, i.e. !xdg-open (Linux), !open
(Mac), or !start (Windows).  To customize this behavior, see
|VimwikiLinkHandler|.

In Vim, "file:" and "local:" behave the same, i.e. you can use them with both
relative and absolute links. When converted to HTML, however, "file:" links
will become absolute links, while "local:" links become relative to the HTML
output directory. The latter can be useful if you copy your HTML files to
another computer.
To customize the HTML conversion of links, see |VimwikiLinkConverter|.

Transclusion (Wiki-Include) Links

Links that use "{{" and "}}" delimiters signify content that is to be
included into the HTML output, rather than referenced via hyperlink.

Wiki-include URLs may use any of the supported schemes, may be absolute or
relative, and need not end with an extension.

The primary purpose for wiki-include links is to include images.

Transclude from a local URL: 
  {{file:../../images/vimwiki_logo.png}}
or from a universal URL: 
  {{http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png}}

Transclude image with alternate text: 
  {{http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png|Vimwiki}}
in HTML: 
  img src="http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png"
  alt="Vimwiki"/

Transclude image with alternate text and some style: 
  {{http://.../vimwiki_logo.png|cool stuff|style="width:150px;height:120px;"}}
in HTML: 
  img src="http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png"
  alt="cool stuff" style="width:150px; height:120px"/

Transclude image _without_ alternate text and with a CSS class: 
  {{http://.../vimwiki_logo.png||class="center flow blabla"}}
in HTML: 
  img src="http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png"
  alt="" class="center flow blabla"/

A trial feature allows you to supply your own handler for wiki-include links.
See |VimwikiWikiIncludeHandler|.

Thumbnail links

Thumbnail links are constructed like this: 
  [[http://someaddr.com/bigpicture.jpg|{{http://someaddr.com/thumbnail.jpg}}]]

in HTML: 
  a href="http://someaddr.com/ ... /.jpg"
  img src="http://../thumbnail.jpg //a

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3. Headers                                          *vimwiki-syntax-headers*

= Header level 1 =
By default all headers are highlighted using |hl-Title| highlight group.

== Header level 2 ==
You can set up different colors for each header level: 
  :hi VimwikiHeader1 guifg=#FF0000
  :hi VimwikiHeader2 guifg=#00FF00
  :hi VimwikiHeader3 guifg=#0000FF
  :hi VimwikiHeader4 guifg=#FF00FF
  :hi VimwikiHeader5 guifg=#00FFFF
  :hi VimwikiHeader6 guifg=#FFFF00
Set up colors for all 6 header levels or none at all.

=== Header level 3 ===
==== Header level 4 ====
===== Header level 5 =====
====== Header level 6 ======


You can center your headers in HTML by placing spaces before the first '=':
                     = Centered Header L1 =


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4. Paragraphs                                    *vimwiki-syntax-paragraphs*

A paragraph is a group of lines starting in column 1 (no indentation).
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line:

This is first paragraph
with two lines.

This is a second paragraph with
two lines.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5. Lists                                              *vimwiki-syntax-lists*

Unordered lists: 
  - Bulleted list item 1
  - Bulleted list item 2
or: 
  * Bulleted list item 1
  * Bulleted list item 2


Ordered lists: 
  1. Numbered list item 1
  2. Numbered list item 2
  3. Numbered list item 3
or: 
  1) Numbered list item 1
  2) Numbered list item 2
  3) Numbered list item 3
or: 
  a) Numbered list item 1
  b) Numbered list item 2
  c) Numbered list item 3
or: 
  A) Numbered list item 1
  B) Numbered list item 2
  C) Numbered list item 3
or: 
  i) Numbered list item 1
  ii) Numbered list item 2
  iii) Numbered list item 3
or: 
  I) Numbered list item 1
  II) Numbered list item 2
  III) Numbered list item 3
or: 
  # Bulleted list item 1
  # the # become numbers when converted to HTML

Note that a space after the list item symbols (-, *, 1. etc.) is essential.

You can nest and mix the various types: 
  - Bulleted list item 1
  - Bulleted list item 2
    a) Numbered list sub item 1
    b) more ...
      * and more ...
      * ...
    c) Numbered list sub item 3
      1. Numbered list sub sub item 1
      2. Numbered list sub sub item 2
    d) etc.
  - Bulleted list item 3

List items can span multiple lines: 
  * Item 1
    Item 1 continued line.
    Item 1 next continued line.
  * Item 2
    - Sub item 1
      Sub item 1 continued line.
      Sub item 1 next continued line.
    - Sub item 2
    - etc.
    Continuation of Item 2
    Next continuation of Item 2


Definition lists: 
  Term 1:: Definition 1
  Term 2::
  :: Definition 2
  :: Definition 3


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.6. Tables                                            *vimwiki-syntax-tables*

Tables are created by entering the content of each cell separated by |
delimiters. You can insert other inline wiki syntax in table cells, including
typeface formatting and links.
For example: 

 | Year | Temperature (low) | Temperature (high) |
 |------|-------------------|--------------------|
 | 1900 | -10               | 25                 |
 | 1910 | -15               | 30                 |
 | 1920 | -10               | 32                 |
 | 1930 | _N/A_             | _N/A_              |
 | 1940 | -2                | 40                 |


In HTML the following part 
 | Year | Temperature (low) | Temperature (high) |
 |------|-------------------|--------------------|

is highlighted as a table header.

If you indent a table then it will be centered in HTML.

If you put  in a cell, the cell spans the left column.
If you put \/ in a cell, the cell spans the above row.
For example: 

 | a  | b  | c | d |
 | \/ | e  |  | f |
 | \/ | \/ |  | g |
 | h  |   |  |  |


See |vimwiki-tables| for more details on how to manage tables.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.7. Preformatted text                           *vimwiki-syntax-preformatted*

Use {{{ and }}} to define a block of preformatted text:
{{{ 
  Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
   In the forests of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
     Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
  In what distant deeps or skies
   Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
    On what wings dare he aspire?
     What the hand dare sieze the fire?
}}}


You can add optional information after the {{{: 
{{{class="brush: python" 
 def hello(world):
     for x in range(10):
         print("Hello {0} number {1}".format(world, x))
}}}

Result of HTML export: 
 pre class="brush: python"
 def hello(world):
     for x in range(10):
         print("Hello {0} number {1}".format(world, x))
 /pre

This might be useful for coloring program code with external JS tools
such as Google's syntax highlighter.

You can setup Vimwiki to highlight code snippets in preformatted text.
See |vimwiki-option-nested_syntaxes|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.8. Mathematical formulae                              *vimwiki-syntax-math*

Mathematical formulae are highlighted, and can be rendered in HTML using the
powerful open source display engine MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org/).

There are three supported syntaxes, which are inline, block display and
block environment.

Inline math is for short formulae within text. It is enclosed by single
dollar signs, e.g.:
 $ \sum_i a_i^2 = 1 $

Block display creates a centered formula with some spacing before and after
it. It must start with a line including only {{$, then an arbitrary number
of mathematical text are allowed, and it must end with a line including only
}}$.
E.g.:
 {{$
 \sum_i a_i^2
 =
 1
 }}$

Note: no matter how many lines are used in the text file, the HTML will
compress it to one line only.

Block environment is similar to block display, but is able to use specific
LaTeX environments, such as 'align'. The syntax is the same as for block
display, except for the first line which is {{$%environment%.
E.g.:
 {{$%align%
 \sum_i a_i^2 &= 1 + 1 \\
 &= 2.
 }}$

Similar compression rules for the HTML page hold (as MathJax interprets the
LaTeX code).

Note: the highlighting in Vim is automatic. For the rendering in HTML, you
have two alternative options:

1. using the MathJax server for rendering (needs internet connection).
Add to your HTML template the following line:

script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"/script

2. installing MathJax locally (faster, no internet required). Choose a
folder on your hard drive and save MathJax in it. Then add to your HTML
template the following line:

script type="text/javascript" src="mathjax_folder/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"/script

where mathjax_folder is the folder on your HD, as a relative path to the
template folder. For instance, a sensible folder structure could be:

- wiki
  - text
  - html
  - templates
  - mathjax

In this case, mathjax_folder would be "../mathjax" (without quotes).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.9. Blockquotes                                  *vimwiki-syntax-blockquotes*

Text which starts with 4 or more spaces is a blockquote.

    This would be a blockquote in Vimwiki. It is not highlighted in Vim but
    could be styled by CSS in HTML. Blockquotes are usually used to quote a
    long piece of text from another source.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.10. Comments                                       *vimwiki-syntax-comments*

A line that starts with %% is a comment.
E.g.: 
 %% this text would not be in HTML


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.11. Horizontal line                                      *vimwiki-syntax-hr*

4 or more dashes at the start of the line is a horizontal line (hr /): 
 ----


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.12. Tags                                               *vimwiki-syntax-tags*

You can tag a wiki file, a header or an arbitrary place in a wiki file. Then,
you can use Vim's built-in tag search functionality (see |tagsrch.txt|) or
Vimwiki's tag related commands to quickly jump to all occurrences of the tag.

A tag is a sequence of non-space characters between two colons: 
        :tag-example:

It is allowed to concatenate multiple tags in one line: 
        :tag-one:tag-two:

If placed in the first two lines of a file, the whole file is tagged.  If
placed under a header, within the 2 lines below it, the header is then tagged
with this tag, and the tag search commands will jump to this specific header.
Otherwise, the tag stands of its own and the search command jumps directly to
it.
